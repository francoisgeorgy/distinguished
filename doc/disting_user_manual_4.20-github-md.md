**Introduction**
>
Congratulations on your purchase of an Expert Sleepers disting mk4.
Please read this user manual before operating your new module.
>
**Installation**
>
House the module in a Eurorack case of your choosing. The power
connector is . If using the power cable supplied with the module, the
red edge of the cable is nearest the bottom of the PCB, and carries
-12V. ("-12V" is marked on the PCB itself next to this end of the
connector.) Be sure to connect the other end of the power cable
correctly, again so -12V corresponds to the red stripe on the cable.
>
***Power requirements***  
The disting mk4 draws 51mA on the +12V rail, and 19mA on the -12V
rail.It does not use the 5V rail.
>
**Inputs, Outputs and Controls**

<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image2.png" style="width:2.28055in;height:3.45278in" />

From top to bottom, the disting has

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>â¢</th>
<th>
A rotary encoder/push button, named 'S'.
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>â¢</td>
<td>
A dot matrix display.
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>â¢</td>
<td>
A MicroSD card slot.
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>â¢</td>
<td>
A knob, referred to as the 'Z' control, which controls some
</td>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td></td>
<td>
function.
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td></td>
<td>
Three input sockets.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

â¦ The top input is the 'Z' CV input, which controls the same thing as
the 'Z' knob. The two are added  
together.
>
â¦ The other two inputs are 'X' and 'Y', and their function
>
depends on the current algorithm.
>
â¢ Two output sockets, named 'A' and 'B'.
>
The sockets are illuminated to reflect the voltage at the socket (or
in the case of 'Z', the combined voltage of the input and the knob).
Red indicates a positive voltage; blue indicates a negative voltage.
>
**Inserting a MicroSD card**  
The disting's MicroSD card slot is to the left of the display.
>
The exposed contacts of the card should face towards the display; the
angled side of the card itself points up.
>
The slot is of the "push-push" type - to remove the card, push it in
slightly and it will spring out.

**Startup**

<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image3.png" style="width:0.30833in;height:0.21667in" />

When the module powers up it first runs through some patterns on its display. The sequence is as follows:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>â¢</th>
<th>
Each of the seven columns in turn, from left to right.
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>â¢</td>
<td>â¢ Each of the five rows in turn, from bottom to top.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

It then shows the bootloader version (e.g. "b1") and the current firmware version (e.g. "v4.0").

If after the above the disting shows the message "Uncalibrated", then the calibration data in flash is missing or
corrupt. A default calibration will be used, but for accurate results, please recalibrate the module (see below).

**The encoder & menu system**

<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image3.png" style="width:0.30833in;height:0.21667in" />

Pressing the encoder ('S') enters the disting's menu system, which is indicated by the display blinking.

At this time the menus are particularly simple, there being only six menu items to choose from, only one of which you
will normally need. In general, the menu system works like this:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>â¢</th>
<th>
Press the encoder to enter menu mode.
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>â¢</td>
<td>
Turn the encoder to select the menu item, and press to select.
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>â¢</td>
<td>â¢ At this point the behaviour depends on the chosen menu item.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Pressing 'Z' at any time cancels and exits the menus.The menu items are:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>â¢</th>
<th>
Algorithm â select algorithm
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>â¢</td>
<td>
Save â save a preset
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>â¢</td>
<td>
Load â load a preset
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>â¢</td>
<td>
Help â access help
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>â¢</td>
<td>
Settings â change settings
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>â¢</td>
<td>
Calibrate â begin calibration
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

â¦ If you accidentally enter this mode, press the Z knob to cancel

**Selecting an algorithm**

<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image3.png" style="width:0.30833in;height:0.21667in" />

There is a single list of algorithms, named A1 up to P8 (i.e. A1, A2, ... up to A8, then B1, B2 etc.). See below for
details.

The algorithm can be chosen via menu 1 "Algorithm". Press the encoder twice (to enter the menu, and to select "
Algorithm"). Then turn the encoder to select the algorithm. Finally, press the encoder again to switch to the chosen
algorithm.

Page 6

**Settings**

<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image3.png" style="width:0.30833in;height:0.21667in" />

The disting has a number of settings, which are stored in flash memory. They are accessed by menu 4 "Settings". Once
you've entered the Settings menu, turn the encoder to select the setting to change.

The settings are:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Once you've chosen the setting to change, press the encoder to select it, at which point the setting's current value
will be shown. Turn the encoder to change the value. Then press the encoder to accept and store the value into flash, or
press Z to leave the menu without storing the value.

**Help**

<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image4.png" style="width:0.30833in;height:0.21667in" />

Accessing 'Help' from the menu displays algorithm-specific information. The help is loaded from the MicroSD card, if
present (else the message
"No card" is displayed), and scrolled across the display. To exit the help function, press Z.

The help text is a simple plain text file on the card, so it can be freely edited (e.g. to put your own choice of
information first, or to translate it into a different language).

Page 7

The default set of help files can be downloaded from the firmware
update page . Simply unzip the file onto your MicroSD card. The file
structure should look something like this:

<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image5.png" style="width:6.69306in;height:3.83889in" />

i.e. the 'help' folder is at the root level of the card, and inside is
a file per algorithm, named 'hXXX.txt', where XXX is the algorithm
number, starting from zero for algorithm A1.
>
**Parameters**

<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image3.png" style="width:0.30833in;height:0.21667in" />

In addition to the control provided on the Z knob, each algorithm may
have up to eight 'parameters', offering further control over the
algorithm's operation.
>
Unlike the Z control, which is sampled at the same high rate as the X
& Y inputs, parameters should be considered coarse, non-real-time
adjustments to the algorithm. They may cause glitching in the outputs
when changed.
>
Parameters are adjusted via the S knob. When changed, the parameter
value is displayed for a couple of seconds.
>
If an algorithm has more than one parameter, pressing the Z knob
cycles through them (unless the algorithm uses Z for Tap Tempo or some
other purpose). The current parameter number is displayed briefly
followed by its name.
>
The current parameter can also be selected by pushing in the S knob
and turning it while holding it in. The parameter number is shown when
you turn the knob; if you pause briefly without turning the knob, the
parameter name is shown.
>
**Knob Recorder**
>
<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image3.png" style="width:0.30833in;height:0.21667in" />  
In many algorithms which do not use a Z knob press for another
purpose, pressing Z offers a 'knob

Page 8

recorder' function.

When this is available, holding Z down while turning it causes the Z value changes to be recorded. As soon as the knob
is released, the recording is played back in a loop. To end playback, turn the Z knob slightly to regain manual control.

The maximum duration of knob recording is a little under 14 seconds.

**Tap Tempo**

<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image3.png" style="width:0.30833in;height:0.21667in" />

Some algorithms (notably the Clockable LFO and Clockable Delay/Echo) use a press of the Z knob as a 'tap tempo'
function. In these modes, pressing Z has the same effect as sending a clock pulse into the clock input. For example,
pressing Z twice will set the delay time/LFO period to the time between the two button presses.

Note that if the algorithm is dividing down the clocked frequency, pressing Z twice will not set the output to the
division of the time between the two presses; rather, it will be the time between a corresponding number of button
presses. E.g. if the Clockable LFO is set to 1/4 (divide by 4), the LFO time will be set by pressing the Z button 5
times, and it will only change on the 5th press.

**Favourites**  
You can define your own list of 16 'favourite' algorithms, via a text file on the MicroSD card.The favourites are
accessed as algorithms O1-P8. If no favourites are defined, or if there are empty slots, the disting runs algorithm A1,
the Precision Adder.

The favourites are read from the SD card, if present, at power on. They are then stored in the disting's flash memory,
and so persist even after the card is removed.

The favourites file is a simple text file which must be named
'favourites.txt' and placed in the root of the SD card (not inside any folder). The contents look something like this:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>
disting favourites v2<br />
B8 VCO<br />
a1<br />
C5 resonator<br />
I4 SD z speed<br />
b5 LFO<br />
e6 dual AR w/ push
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The first line must be "disting favourites v2". Subsequent lines specify an algorithm to add to the list of favourites.
After 16 algorithms, any further lines are ignored.

Each algorithm is specified as its two character name (a letter followed by a number). Any further text after the
algorithm number is ignored, so you can add a descriptive string (as in the example above) to help you remember what's
what.

**Presets**
>
<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image3.png" style="width:0.30833in;height:0.21667in" />  
The disting can store its current state to flash memory as a preset.
The contents of a preset are

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>â¢</th>
<th>
the chosen algorithm.
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>â¢</td>
<td>
the parameter values.
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>â¢</td>
<td>
the current parameter number.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Anything controlled by the Z knob/CV is not stored â its value is
always defined by the knob position and CV input.
>
There are 64 preset slots. Presets are saved and recalled using the
menu. To save a preset: 1. Press the encoder to enter menu mode.
>
2\. Turn the encoder once (to show 'Save'), and press to confirm.
>
3\. Turn the encoder to choose the preset slot.
>
4\. Press the encoder to complete the save.
>
As usual, pressing Z at any point exits the menu without saving.
>
To load a preset:
1. Press the encoder to enter menu mode.
>
2\. Turn the encoder twice (to show 'Load'), and press to confirm.
>
3\. Turn the encoder to choose the preset slot.
>
4\. Press the encoder to complete the load.
>
If the current algorithm was selected via the Favourites, the actual
algorithm chosen is saved in the preset, not the favourites slot.1
>
***Preset 0***  
Preset 0, the first slot, is special:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>â¢</th>
<th>
The contents of preset 0 are loaded at power-up.
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>â¢</td>
<td>â¢ When switching algorithm, the new algorithm state is saved to preset 0.2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Therefore if you want to save the disting's state so it powers up as
it is currently, you can manually save to preset 0, which is âclick,
turn, click, clickâ on the encoder.
>
Preset 0 is also an exception to the above comment regarding
favourites. The actual favourites slot is stored.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>1</th>
<th>1 So if you change the favourites, the presets are unaffected.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>2</td>
<td>The thinking here is that if you forget to save your preset before turning off the power, at least the disting will come</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td></td>
<td>
back up in the same algorithm next time you start.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Select Bus**
>
<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image3.png" style="width:0.30833in;height:0.21667in" />  
If enabled in the settings, the disting mk4 will respond to
save/recall messages on the Select Bus.
>
The Select Bus is a means of inter-module communication currently
supported by a handful of modules from various manufacturers,
including the , and the & .
>
Note that the disting only responds to save/recall messages. It does
not initiate them.
>
Any MIDI that arrives on the Select Bus that is not explicitly part of
the Select Bus protocol will be used as if it arrived on the disting's
regular MIDI input â see below.

**SD Card Playback**
>
***Supported MicroSD cards***
>
In theory any MicroSD card will work, but in practice there is a huge
variety of cards on the market and we cannot possibly test them all.
We recommend 32GB SDHC cards, and in particular have found "SanDisk
Extreme 32GB microSDHC UHS-I U3" cards work well.
>
The MicroSD card must be formatted in FAT32 format, which is the
as-sold state for many cards. If not, cards can easily be reformatted
to FAT32 in Windows or macOS.
>
The card also needs to be partitioned using the 'Master Boot Record'
(MBR) scheme. In macOS's Disk Utility, you may need to select
View-&gt;Show All Devices to inspect the partitioning scheme.
>
The Erase settings should look like this:

<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image6.png" style="width:6.69306in;height:4.17778in" />

***Supported audio files***

As of now, the only supported audio file format is 16 bit WAV, mono or
stereo. Any sample rate can be used, however.
>
Since higher sample rates impose greater bandwidth demands on the SD
card streaming, we suggest you use the lowest sample rate that gives
acceptable audio quality. All our testing generally uses 44.1kHz
files.
>
Note that because the disting's outputs are DC-coupled, the 'audio'
files can actually contain recorded or generated CVs, so all the
sample playback modes can also be used as complex modulation or
sequencing sources.
>
***Audio file naming & Playlists***  
Audio files must have the extension '.wav' (or any other
capitalisation of that e.g. '.WAV').

The files should be placed in folders on the SD card. Unless noted
otherwise, audio playback algorithms all support up to 100 folders of
100 sample files each. The folders themselves should be at the top
level of the card i.e. not inside any higher level folder.
>
The disting also supports 'playlist' files, which are simple text
files that instruct the disting which files/folders to look at and
which ones to ignore, and also allow setting of options on a
per-sample file basis. Unless noted otherwise these files are
optional.
>
The playlist filename is 'playlist.txt'. If a playlist is found in the
root of the card, it will be taken as a list of folders in which to
look for WAV files. If a playlist is found inside a folder of WAV
files, it will be used to determine which files to use, the order in
which to use them, and to set the per-file options.
>
Note that it is explicitly allowed to have a playlist file which only
contains global settings, but lists no actual WAV files. In this case,
the settings in the playlist will be used, and the folder scanned for
WAV files automatically.
>
If playlists are not used, folder and file names are sorted
alphabetically.
>
***Loop markers in audio files***
>
The disting supports reading loop information embedded in the WAV
file. If this information is not present, or is disabled with the
playlist option (see below), any mode that loops the sample simply
loops the whole file.
>
Loops are inferred either from markers (cue points in WAV format
parlance) or regions, as follows:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>
1 marker point in file
</th>
<th>
Marker is assumed to be loop start; loop is from the marker to the end of the sample.
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>
2 marker points in file
</td>
<td>
Markers are used as loop start and end.
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>
3 or more marker points in file
</td>
<td>
First marker is ignored (assumed to be playback start point); second and third markers used as loop points. Remaining markers ignored.
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>
1 or more regions in file
</td>
<td>
First region is used as the loop; other regions and markers ignored.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

This video illustrates the use of loop markers:

***Supported MIDI files***
>
Currently we support Format 0 files (single track). The division field
of the header chunk must be in "ticks per quarter note" format.
>
Happily this is the format that Ableton Live spits out if you do
"Export MIDI Clip".
>
***MIDI file naming & Playlists***
>
All MIDI files need to be in a folder named 'MIDI'3. They can use any
naming convention but the extension '.mid' is usual.
>
A playlist file (see below) specifies what MIDI files the algorithm
will use, how they will be ordered, and what playback settings they
will use. It is a simple text file, as described below, and is
>
3 Note that this changed in firmware 4.19 â previously the MIDI files
went in the card root.

optional. If no playlist is provided, the MIDI playback algorithms
search for any '.mid' files in the 'MIDI' folder. Of course, if you do
not provide a playlist, you cannot customise the settings for the MIDI
files.
>
By default, MIDI algorithms look for a file named 'midi-playlist.txt'.
However, each MIDI playback algorithm first looks for an
algorithm-specific playlist file, the name of which is specified in
the algorithm descriptions below.
>
The playlist files must be plain text. Note that TextEdit on macOS
defaults to rich text. From the 'Format' menu choose, 'Make Plain
Text'.
>
***Audio Playlist Format***  
An audio playlist file might look something like this:

The fades are useful when retriggering samples, especially when
starting them at arbitrary points within the sample, to avoid clicks.
However, for maximum responsiveness when triggering, say, drum
samples, set the fades and gap to zero.
>
The default behaviour (with retriggerOnSampleChange=1) when selecting
a new sample (via S or Z depending on algorithm) is to immediately
begin playing the new sample. If a sample has
retriggerOnSampleChange=0 (or, if the default is set to 0) then the
next sample does not begin playback until triggered by the input. A
typical use case for this would be when you have a set of one-shot
(say, drum) samples and you want to trigger each sample and have it
play until the next trigger, not changing in the middle if the sample
select CV changes. At an extreme, you could in this case feed white
noise into the sample select CV, to choose a random sample on each
trigger.
>
The fixedPitch setting is a floating point number, where 1.0
corresponds to playing the sample at its natural speed, 0.5 means play
it at half speed etc. fixedPitch=0 (the default) means that the sample
respects the CV-controlled pitch.
>
ramp=1 outputs a rising ramp from 0V to +8V corresponding to the
current position in the sample. ramp=-1 outputs a falling ramp (+8V to
0V).
>
triggers outputs a number of triggers during the sample e.g.
triggers=4 will output 4 trigger pulses, equally spaced over the
sample length. The triggers are +5V pulses lasting about 10ms. The
maximum number of triggers per sample is 32767. This video
demonstrates the triggers feature:

<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image3.png" style="width:0.30833in;height:0.21667in" />

ramp and triggers are mutually exclusive. The last setting in the
playlist file for a given sample is the one that takes effect.
>
natural and switch are used only by the Multisample Audio Playback
algorithm (see below).
>
playToCompletion applies to one-shot (non-looping) samples only. If
set, the sample can not be retriggered, either by a trigger CV or by
the current sample changing, until it has played all the way through.
>
useStartOnSampleChange controls the behaviour when the current sample
is changed, without an explicit trigger (e.g. when turning the Z knob
in the I-1 Audio Playback algorithm).

When this is 0 (the default), the new sample starts playing at the
same point relative to the start as the previous sample. When set to
1, the new sample starts at the point defined by the start position CV
(if the algorithm has one) or at the beginning.
>
startQuantize applies to any algorithm where playback can be
retriggered and which provides a CV for the start position. The length
of the file will be equally divided into the number of steps set by
startQuantize, and retriggering will restart playback at the start of
one of these steps. For example if you have a one bar loop (in 4/4
time) and specify startQuantize=4 then playback will always be
triggered at the beginning of a beat within the sample.
>
The maximum number of sample files per playlist is 100. Files beyond
that limit are ignored.

The default behaviour (with retriggerOnSampleChange=1) when selecting
a new file is to immediately begin playing the new file. If a file has
retriggerOnSampleChange=0 (or, if the default is set to 0) then the
next file not begin playback until triggered by the input.

The maximum number of MIDI files per playlist is 32. Files beyond that
limit are ignored.
>
***Example Files***
>
A simple example playlist and some audio files which are known to be
formatted correctly can be downloaded 4.
>
***MIDI/CV conversion***  
The are three primary modes of MIDI/CV conversion, which can be mixed
within a MIDI file: 1. Note on/off messages, and pitch bend messages,
are used to generate a pitch CV from output
>
A and a gate CV from output B.
>
2\. The two highest MIDI notes (126 & 127, aka Fâ¯9 & G9) are converted
to gates on outputs A
>
& B respectively. The amplitude of the gates is 5V scaled by the note
velocity.
>
3\. CCs \#1 & \#2 are used to directly control voltages on outputs A &
B respectively. The 7 bit
>
CC value (0-127) is converted to a voltage according to the scale and
offset settings (by default, 0-5V).
>
**Scala Support**
>
Some disting algorithms support microtonal scales, using files
generated by the program Scala5. The files are loaded from the MicroSD
card. See 'Supported MicroSD cards' above.
>
***Organising the files on the card***  
To use Scala with the disting, you will need a MicroSD card set up as
follows.

Output A is the result of multiplying inputs X & Y. Output B is the
inverse of output A.
>
If for example X is a signal and Y is an envelope, then this algorithm
is a VCA. If both inputs are signals, then this is a ring modulator.

The Z knob/CV sets a scale factor which is applied to both outputs. The scale is an integer (whole number) which either
multiplies or divides the result, and ranges in value from 1-10.

When Z changes, the scale is shown on the display. If the value shown is negative, it is a divisor rather than a
multiplier. Note that there is no value of "-1" since dividing by 1 and multiplying by 1 are the same. After a short
while the display reverts to showing the current algorithm.

When parameter 0 is 1, the scale is not restricted to integer steps, and changes smoothly with Z.

Parameter 1 applies an offset to the Y input, in whole Volts. This is convenient if you just want to multiply the X
input by a constant, which you can then dial in with the Y Offset and Z.

***A-3 Full-wave Rectifier***

|----------------------------------|
| **B = abs( X - Y ) or abs( Y )** |
| **Z selects mode**               |

This algorithm provides a full-wave rectifier or absolute value function. The Z knob/CV select between one of two modes.
In
'independent' mode, A and B are the absolute values of X and Y, respectively. In 'combined' mode, A is the absolute
value of the sum of X & Y; B is the absolute value of the difference of X & Y.

When Z changes, the mode is displayed. 'Independent' mode is shown as
"-0"; 'combined' mode as "0". After a short while the display reverts to showing the current algorithm.

***A-4 Minimum/maximum***

| **A = min( X, Y )** |
|---------------------|
| **B = max( X, Y )** |
| **Z is gate**       |

Output A is the minimum of inputs X & Y; output B is the maximum of the two inputs. If one input is zero (or
disconnected), this is a half-wave rectifier.

The Z knob/CV provides a gate function. When Z goes higher than approximately 2.5V, the gate goes high and the outputs
follow the inputs according to the min/max relationship. When Z goes below approximately -1.5V, the gate goes low and
the outputs are frozen.

When the gate changes state, "LO" or "HI" is displayed to indicate the gate status. After a short while the display
reverts to showing the current algorithm.

This algorithm provides a linear-to-exponential converter and an exponential-to-linear converter. You might use this to
interface 1V/octave modules (Eurorack standard) with Hz/V synths (e.g. old Korg or Yamaha synths), but it could also be
useful within Eurorack e.g. to convert an LFO (commonly with Hz/V pitch control) to a V/octave oscillator, or to convert
an exponential FM input on a VCO into a linear FM input.

Input X is the exponential input; its corresponding linear output is A. Y is the linear input, whose exponential output
is B.

Z sets the scale factor which is common to both conversions. It sets the number of Hz per Volt, with arrange from near
zero to about 2kHz. The Yamaha CS-15, for example, uses about 1100Hz/V, which is about half way on the Z knob here.

The zero Volt point on the exponential scale used is C3 (approximately 130.81Hz).

Parameters 0 & 1 switch their respective outputs to function as gate inverters. (Some old synths e.g. the Korg MS-20
have a Hz/V pitch input and an inverted gate, compared to the Eurorack norm.) The output is then 5V/0V for an input gate
in excess of 1V.

Output A is a quantized version of input X; the closest whole-semitone value to the unquantized V/octave pitch CV X.
Output B is a trigger signal which fires whenever output A changes - a 5V pulse approximately 10ms long.

As well as providing a chromatic scale, this algorithm can also constrain the quantized values to a musical scale or
chord. This is controlled by the Z knob/CV.

When Z changes, the scale is displayed on the LEDs. The scale's number in the following table is shown, and after a
short pause, the scale's name.

| **Number** | **Scale**            | **Displayed name** |
|------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| 0          | chromatic            | Chromatic          |

| 14         | natural minor scale  | Nat Minor          |
| 15         | harmonic minor scale | Harm Minor         |

A further option is controlled by Z being positive or negative. When Z is negative, the scale number is shown as a
negative value.

**When Z is positive** input Y is a transpose control. The CV on input Y is quantized (to a chromatic scale) and added
to the quantized result in one of two ways, controlled by parameter 1. If parameter 1 is zero, the transposition is
applied to output A, after input X has been quantized to the chosen scale. If parameter 1 is one, the transposition is
applied to input X before it is forced into the chosen scale. So, in mode zero the overall key of the quantization is
transposed, whereas in mode one the transposition moves the notes around within the same key.

**When Z is negative** input Y is a trigger. In this mode, input X is only sampled and converted to a new quantized
value when input Y rises over approximately 1V. (In non-triggered mode, X is constantly sampled and a new note is output
as soon as X moves into the next semitone range.)

Parameter 2 sets the root **key** of the chosen scale. At zero, the first note of the scale (e.g. C in the key of C)
corresponds to 0V. If the parameter is set for example to 2, the first note of the scale is at 2/12 = 0.1667V - or to
look at it another way, if your VCO is tuned so that 0V gives you a C, the quantizer is now working in the key of D (D
major, minor, triad etc. depending on the scale setting).

Parameter 3 sets an offset between the timing of the X & Y inputs (in sample frames). When using Y as a trigger, it is
often a good idea to delay it slightly relative to the pitch, to ensure that the pitch has changed and settled before
the trigger samples a new note.

**MIDI Output**: each new note (i.e. when the Output B trigger fires) is output as a MIDI note message on the MIDI
channel selected in the settings.

Parameter 4 controls when note off messages are sent. If parameter 4 is zero (the default), the note off is sent just
before the note on â so the note lasts from one change to the next, which is conceptually the same as the CV output. If
parameter 4 is one, and Z is negative (so Y is a trigger), then the trigger is treated as a gate, and the note off
message is sent when the gate goes low.

**MIDI Input**: MIDI note messages received on MIDI channel 1 set parameter 2 (root key).

***A-7 Comparator***

<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image4.png" style="width:0.30833in;height:0.21667in" />

| **A = gate from X &gt; Y** |
|----------------------------|
| **B = inverted gate**      |
| **Z is hysteresis**        |

Output A is a gate signal (zero or +5V), high when input X has a higher voltage than input Y. Output B is an inverted
copy of A (i.e. +5V when A is 0V and vice versa.)

The Z knob/CV input sets the hysteresis (for an explanation of hysteresis see ). Inputs of approximately 0-4V correspond
to hysteresis values of approximately 0-10V. Negative values are clamped at zero.

This algorithm provides two independent waveshaping functions. The Z knob/CV is a gain control, with a range of
approximately 30x. Negative values of Z invert the signal.

Output A provides a waveshaped version of input X; output B provides a waveshaped version of input Y.

Parameters 0 & 1 choose what type of waveshaping is applied.

Type 0 is what is usually termed a wavefolder. This increases the harmonic content of the sound in interesting ways,
especially as the gain changes.

Type 1 is a triangle-to-sine waveshaper. Used on most audio this is a relatively gentle form of overdrive/saturation.
However, when fed with the right level of triangle wave, the output is exactly a sine wave, which is useful when you
have a triangle wave VCO handy but really want a pure sine wave instead.

**If parameter 0 is 0 (the default)**:  
Output A is a sample of input X, taken when the trigger input Y goes over 1V. (Sample and Hold) **If parameter 0 is
1**:  
Output A follows input X while input Y is over 1V. When Y falls below 0.5V, output A is held until Y goes over 1V
again. (Track and Hold)

Output B is a noise signal. Noise is commonly fed into the input of a sample and hold device to generate clocked random
voltages. The amplitude of output B is set by parameter 4; the maximum is Â±8V.

Parameter 2 controls the noise colour:

The Z knob/CV controls the slew rate of output A. At the minimum value of Z, changes in A are instantaneous. As Z
increases, changes in A take place more slowly.

Parameters 5 & 6 allow you to specify different slew rates when the signal rises or falls. If the parameter is -1, the
slew time is set from Z; otherwise the slew is set from the parameter value.

Pressing the Z knob triggers a sample manually.

Parameter 1 sets an offset between the timing of the X & Y inputs (in sample frames). If X & Y are being driven
together, for example by a sequencer's pitch and gate, it is often a good idea to delay the trigger slightly to allow
time for the sampled CV to settle before the sample is taken.

Parameter 3 adds the noise output into the input signal, equivalent to patching output B into input X via an attenuator.

Outputs A & B are slew rate limited versions of X & Y. If parameter 4 is 0, they are both based on the sum of X + Y; if
parameter 4 is 1, A is based on X, and B is based on Y.

Parameters 2 & 3 choose the type of slew rate limiting applied to A & B respectively. A parameter value of 0 gives
linear slew rate limiting; a step change in the input will typically result in a ramp output, until the output reaches
its desired value, at which point it will be constant. A parameter value of 1 gives logarithmic slew rate limiting; a
step change in input results in a smooth curve that gradually approaches the desired value.

The Z knob/CV controls the slew rate for both outputs. At the minimum value of Z, changes are very rapid. As Z
increases, changes take place more slowly.

Parameters 0 & 1 allow for independent control of the slew times when the signal is rising or falling. If each parameter
is -1, the corresponding slew rate is controlled by Z. Otherwise, the slew rate is set by the parameter value.

***B-3 Pitch and Envelope Tracker***

<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image3.png" style="width:0.30833in;height:0.21667in" />

| **A = V/octave pitch derived from X, plus Y** |
|-----------------------------------------------|
| **B = envelope dervied from X**               |
| **Z is slew rate for envelope**               |

This algorithm provides pitch and envelope tracking of an incoming audio signal. It will track frequencies down to about
27Hz, which is just below the lowest note on a standard 88 key piano.

Output A is a 1V/octave pitch CV reflecting the pitch of the signal on input X. The 0V point is C3 (approximately
130.81Hz). Input Y is simply added to the pitch CV, providing a means of applying e.g. vibrato, or transposition.

Output B tracks the envelope of the signal on input X. It goes to zero when the algorithm fails to track a pitch.

Knob/CV Z sets the slew rate of the envelope, controlling how quickly it tracks changes in level. At the minimum value
of Z, changes can be very rapid, which may produce undesirable effects, especially if pitch tracking is not working
well. As Z increases, changes take place more slowly.

This algorithm is a delay/echo effect, primarily intended for processing audio signals, where the delay time is set from
a clock pulse. It operates at a quarter of the standard sample rate (i.e. at about 19kHz)
and offers a maximum delay time of about 1700ms.

Input X is the signal input. Any audio signal can be fed in here.

Input Y is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. The time between rising trigger edges is used
to set the delay time. If the time between triggers is greater than the maximum delay time, the time is divided by two
until it is small enough. This way, you always end up with a rhythmically useful delay time.

The Z knob/CV controls the feedback, from zero to slightly more than 100%.Outputs A & B carry signals according to
parameter 1:

'Mix' is a mix of the dry (undelayed) signal and the delay effect. The amount of delay in the mix rises in direct
proportion to the amount of feedback.

'Delay only' is the delayed signal only. Use this and the input signal, plus an external mixer, if you need more
flexibility in the dry/wet balance than is offered by the mixed mode.

The first parameter applies a multiplier to the delay time, according to the following table:

Outputs A & B are LFOs (low frequency oscillators), with CV control of frequency and waveshape. The output signals are
Â±8V (16V peak-to-peak)
by default, but can be attenuated via the parameters.

The outputs can also have a DC offset applied. The offset in Volts is
(parameter value)/4 i.e. the range is Â±10V, in steps of 0.25V.

Input X is a Hz/V frequency control, scaled at 1Hz/V. Note that the input is allowed to go negative, resulting in a
phase-reversed output.

Knob/CV Z is a tuning control, with a range of approximately Â±10Hz. This is simply added to the setting from input X (so
with input X disconnected, the knob can be used to manually set an LFO rate).

Input Y controls the waveshape of the output signals. Signals in the range Â±5V give the full range of possible
waveshapes:

Outputs A & B are LFOs (low frequency oscillators), with CV control of waveshape, and with the LFO cycle time set from a
clock input. The output signals are Â±8V (16V peak-to-peak) by default, but can be attenuated and inverted via parameters
0 & 1.

Input X is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. The time between rising trigger edges is used
to set the cycle time.

Input Y controls the waveshape of the output signals. Signals in the range Â±5V give the full range of possible

Parameter 2 is an offset added to the Y CV, allowing manual selection of the waveshape.

The Z knob/CV sets a scale factor which is applied to the cycle time. The scale is an integer (whole number) which
either multiplies or divides the frequency, and ranges in value from 1-16.

When Z changes, the scale is shown on the display. If the value shown is negative, it is a divisor rather than a
multiplier. Note that there is no value of "-1" since dividing by 1 and multiplying by 1 are the same.

This algorithm is a VCO with a 1V/octave pitch CV input (X), and a linear FM input (Y), scaled at 100Hz/V. Note that, if
the FM input goes sufficiently negative, it will take the frequency through and below zero, resulting in a phase
inversion ("thru-zero FM").

The 0V point for the pitch input is C3 (approximately 130.81Hz).

The Z knob/CV provides a tuning control, with a range of approximately Â±0.5 octaves.

The A and B outputs provide waveforms according to the following table:

Parameters 3 & 4 control the waveform of outputs A & B respectively. The output signals are Â±8V (16V peak-to-peak) by
default, but can be attenuated via parameters 1 & 2.

**MIDI Input**: MIDI note messages received on the MIDI channel set in the Settings are converted to a CV which is added
to that on input X. The 0V note is 48 (C3). MIDI notes also drive the 'MIDI gate' output option.

The output signals are Â±8V (16V peak-to-peak) by default, but can be attenuated via parameters 1 and 2.

Parameter 3 offsets the Y input, effectively providing a manual shape control if required.

Parameter 5 transposes the VCO pitch, in semitone increments.

Parameter 6 controls the function of Z. At the default value of -51, Z is the tune control as already

mentioned. When the parameter is set to a value from -50 to 50, Z no
longer affects the tuning, and the parameter value is used as a fine
tune control, in cents. Z then becomes a sync input: when Z goes over
approximately 1V, the VCO phase is reset to zero, which can produce
'oscillator sync' sounds8.

This algorithm is basically the same as A-1 Precision Adder above,
except that where the other algorithm has offsets in steps of 1V, this
algorithm allows you to set a divisor for the offset. This defaults to
12, so when used to offset a 1V/octave pitch CV the offsets correspond
to semitones.

This algorithm is a voltage controlled delay line, with a maximum
delay time of just over 200ms. As well as simple echoes, this can
produce a wide variety of effects such as vibrato, chorus and flange.
>
A control signal of 0-8V on the Y input sets the delay time, with a
linear voltage/time relationship. Parameter 0 can be used to set this
to a 'centre' value, which makes it easier to patch in an LFO to the Y
input without having to add a DC offset to the LFO.
>
Parameter 1 is an attenuverter for Y, applied before the offset.
>
Z is a feedback control. It is zero at 0V input, and provides negative
feedback for negative voltages.A outputs the delay signal only. Use
this for vibrato effects, or if you want a controllable mix of dry

and delayed signal.

B outputs the delay and dry signals mixed in equal amounts. In combination with an LFO on the delay time, this is the
quickest route to chorus/flange type effects.

Parameter 2 enables a saturation stage on the input to the delay line. This can prevent unpleasant distortion when the
feedback becomes high, at the expense of some colouration of the sound.

This algorithm is a stereo ping-pong delay/echo effect, primarily intended for processing audio signals, where the delay
time is set from a clock pulse. It operates at a quarter of the standard sample rate
(i.e. at about 19kHz) and offers a maximum delay time of about 900ms.

Input X is the signal input. Any audio signal can be fed in here.

Input Y is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. The time between rising trigger edges is used
to set the delay time. If the time between triggers is greater than the maximum delay time, the time is divided by two
until it is small enough. This way, you always end up with a rhythmically useful delay time.

Parameter 1 applies a multiplier to the delay time, according to the table above.

The Z knob/CV controls the feedback, from zero to slightly more than 100%.

Outputs A & B are the left and right outputs respectively. If the output mode parameter is 0 (the default), they are a
mix of the dry (undelayed)
signal and the delay effect. The amount of delay in the mix rises in direct proportion to the amount of feedback. If the
output mode parameter is 1, the outputs are the delayed signals only. Use this and the input signal, plus an external
mixer, if you need more flexibility in the dry/wet balance than is offered by output mode 0.

Parameter 2 controls the left/right pan position of the input signal.

This algorithm is a stereo ping-pong delay/echo effect, primarily intended for processing audio signals, where the delay
time is set from a clock pulse. It operates at a quarter of the standard sample rate
(i.e. at about 19kHz) and offers a maximum delay time of about 900ms.

Input X is the signal input. Any audio signal can be fed in here.

Input Y is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. The time between rising trigger edges is used
to set the delay time. If the time between triggers is greater than the maximum delay time, the time is divided by two
until it is small enough. This way, you always end up with a rhythmically useful delay time.

Parameter 1 applies a multiplier to the delay time, according to the table above.

The Z knob/CV controls the left/right pan position of the input signal.

Outputs A & B are the left and right outputs respectively. If the output mode parameter is 0 (the default), they are a
mix of the dry (undelayed)
signal and the delay effect. The amount of delay in the mix rises in direct proportion to the amount of feedback. If the
output mode parameter is 1, the outputs are the delayed signals only. Use this and the input signal, plus an external
mixer, if you need more flexibility in the dry/wet balance than is offered by output mode 0.

The delay feedback is set via parameter 0.

This algorithm implements a resonator, which is a kind of filter, but which is also often found as the

basis for analogue drum synthesis.

X is the input for the signal to filter. If used as a drum synth, this is the trigger input. The amplitude and nature of
the trigger signal will affect the resulting sound. If parameter 1 is set to '1', the input is treated as an actual
trigger, not an audio signal, triggering a pulse when the input goes over 1V.

Y sets the pitch of the resonator, with a 1V/octave response. The 0V point for the pitch input is C3 (approximately
130.81Hz). Parameter 0 provides a pitch offset in semitones.

Z sets the gain. In terms of drum synthesis, more gain means a longer decay time.

A is the audio output.

B outputs the result of envelope tracking the audio output A.

Pressing Z simulates hitting X with a 1ms 5V pulse, and so works as a manual trigger of the 'drum'.

This algorithm implements a vocoder. The spectral characteristics of the modulator input are applied to the carrier
input. In classic usage, the modulator might be a human voice, and the carrier might be a synth sound, or simply noise.

X is the modulator input, and Y is the carrier input.

A is the audio output. B outputs a CV related to the envelope of the modulator signal.

The Z control sets the decay time of the internal envelope trackers, which track each band of the modulator signal. Use
low values (negative Z) for most intelligible speech.

Parameter 0 selects between alternative filter banks:

This algorithm implements a phase shifter or 'phaser' effect.

X is the audio input.

Y is the sweep input. 0V to 8V covers the whole range; negative voltages are treated as 0V. You will almost always want
to patch an LFO in here. Parameter 0 can be used to set this to a 'centre' value, which makes it easier to patch in an
LFO to the Y input without having to add a DC offset to the LFO.

Z controls feedback. More feedback results in more extreme phasing effects. When Z is negative, the feedback is
inverted, which gives a different-sounding phasing effect.

A outputs the combination of the phase-shifted signal and the original signal, which is usually what you need for a
classic phaser effect, since it's the interaction of the original signal and the phaseshifted version which produces
the 'comb filtering' effect.

Output B provides just the phase shifted signal, if you need more contorl over how this and the original signal are
mixed.

Parameter 1 sets the number of phase shifting stages. The more stages, the more notches there are in the comb filter,
which results in a more pronounced effect.

This algorithm is a 'bit crusher' - it applies sample rate and sample depth reduction to deliberately introduce
quantisation and aliasing artefacts. It also optionally applies bitwise modification of the samples for non-linear
distortion effects.

X is the signal input.

Y is the sample rate reduction CV input. It has a 1V/octave response i.e. the sample rate is reduced by a factor of 2
for every 1V rise in CV. This CV is offset by parameter 0, so you can set a rate reduction without a CV input.

A is the signal output.

B is the output of a comparator. Output A is compared against zero; output B is +5V if A is above zero, or 0V if A is
below zero.

The Z control sets the bit depth reduction. There are two types of bit reduction available:

This is stereo filter which sweeps from lowpass to highpass on a single knob.

The Z knob/CV sets the filter cutoff. At the central, zero position no filter effect is applied. If the knob is turned
anticlockwise, a lowpass filter is applied, with a cutoff frequency that sweeps down the more you turn. If the knob is
turned clockwise from centre, a highpass filter is applied, with a cutoff frequency that sweeps up the more you turn.

This is a delay/echo effect which simulates a variable speed tape loop echo device. The delay time at '1x speed', with
the tape length parameter at maximum, is just over 400ms.

X is the audio input.

Parameters 0 & 1 together set the 'tape length', effectively setting the delay time. Parameter 0 is scaled in 10ms
increments, while parameter 1 is in 1ms increments (both assuming 1x 'tape speed').

Y controls the speed of the 'tape', which also affects the delay time. The voltage/speed relationship is 8V/octave. If
you consider 0V as '1x speed', then +8V gives '2x speed' (the maximum) and -4V gives 'half speed' (the minimum).
Parameter 2 can be used to set the speed manually; its value is added to that of the Y input.

The Z knob/CV controls the feedback, from zero to slightly more than 100%.Outputs A & B carry signals according to
parameter 3:

'Mix' is a mix of the dry (undelayed) signal and the delay effect. The amount of delay in the mix rises in direct
proportion to the amount of feedback.

'Delay only' is the delayed signal only. Use this and the input signal, plus an external mixer, if you need more
flexibility in the dry/wet balance than is offered by the mixed mode.

This algorithm recreates a popular analogue circuit variously known as a waveform animator or wave multiplier. Such a
circuit, when given
(typically) a sawtooth waveform as input, uses a comparator to generate a square wave of suitable phase and pulsewidth
such that when the square and saw waves are added together the result is a phase shifted saw waveform. This is usually
done a number of times and the results added with the overall effect of turning the original, rather plain, waveform
into a much richer one which to all intents and purposes is the same as if you'd started with a number of VCOs rather
than just one, and so sounds "fatter". In combination with LFOs varying the comparator thresholds, very rich textures
can be generated.

Here, four comparators and four LFOs are used.

X is the audio input.

The thresholds of the comparators are set by a combination of Y and Z. Y sets the 'centre' threshold; Z sets a 'spread'
of the individual thresholds around the centre. Parameter 1 also sets the centre.

Parameter 0 sets the LFO depth. Parameter 2 scales the LFO rates; the four LFOs have preset individual speeds, which the
parameter multiplies.

Parameter 3 sets the 'scale'. The recreation of phase shifted sawtooths works best when the square wave amplitude is
matched to that of the saw. The default setting of -1 uses an envelope tracker to automatically set the square amplitude
from the incoming audio. Other values directly set the amplitude (31 corresponds to Â±8V). Fixing the amplitude of the
square waves and varying the input signal's amplitude is a useful effect in its own right.

Output A is the animated output (sum of the orignal signal and the comparator outputs). Output B is just the square
waves.

This is a 2nd-order filter, with a voltage controllable response type. By varying Z, the output can be low pass, band
pass or high pass, or blends in between.

X is the audio input.

Y sets the filter frequency, with a 1V/octave response. The 0V point is C3 (approximately 130.81Hz). Parameter 0 is
added to the Y CV; its range of Â±80 corresponds to Â±5V.

Z sets the filter type output at A & B.

Output A blends smoothly between low pass (at minimum Z), through band pass (at zero Z), to high pass (at maximum Z).

Output B blends smoothly between high pass (at minimum Z), through band pass (at zero Z), to low pass (at maximum Z).

Parameter 1 sets the filter resonance.

This algorithm is a two-stage (attack/release or attack/decay) envelope generator.

Inputs X & Y are trigger inputs. A signal in excess of 1V on either input will trigger the envelope, according to the
mode set by parameter

0. In trigger mode 0, the envelope will rise to full level and stay there as long as the input is high (AR mode). In
   trigger mode 1, the envelope will execute one full attack/decay cycle in response to a trigger input (AD mode). In
   trigger mode 2, the envelope will continually execute attack/decay cycles as long as the trigger is high
   (looped AD mode).

Z sets the envelope times, according to the mode set by parameter 1. In Z mode 0, the full range of Z values sweeps from
short A & D, through short A & long D, through long A & D, through long A & short D, and finally back to short A & D. In
Z mode 1, Z sets the A & D times to the same value, from very short times (about 10ms) to very long times (about 8s).

A & B both output the envelope CV. Each has its own attenuverter parameter, which can attenuate and/or invert the
signal. The maximum envelope level is 10V, with the default parameter value of 32 giving an 8V envelope. Each output
also has an offset parameter, which can move the whole envelope up or down by up to 10V.

If parameter 2 is set to the special value 41, output A becomes an end-of-cycle trigger output, generating a 10ms 5V
pulse at the end of the envelope's release stage.

Parameters 6 & 7 set the attack and release shapes of the envelope respectively, from an exaggerated exponential curve
at 0 to an almost linear shape at 32.

Pushing the Z knob has the same effect as triggering the envelope via the X or Y inputs.

**MIDI Input**: Any MIDI note messages received on the MIDI channel set in the Settings trigger the envelope.

This algorithm is a combined two-stage (attack/release or attack/decay)
envelope generator & VCA (voltage controlled amplifier).

Input X is the trigger input. A signal in excess of 1V will trigger the envelope, according to the mode set by parameter

0. In trigger mode 0, the envelope will rise to full level and stay there as long as the input is high (AR mode). In
   trigger mode 1, the envelope will execute one full attack/decay cycle in response to a trigger input (AD mode). In
   trigger mode 2, the envelope will continually execute attack/decay cycles as long as the trigger is high (looped AD
   mode).

Trigger modes 3-8 work like modes 1-2 except that the source of the trigger is the tracked envelope of one of the
inputs. Modes 3-5 use input X and modes 6-8 use input Y. So for example mode 6 triggers the envelope generator from the
VCA input signal, i.e. the algorithm is behaving as an 'envelope modifier' effect â put a guitar in here for automatic
slow swells.

Input Y is the VCA input. The signal here will be multiplied by the envelope and output on output B.

Z sets the envelope times, according to the mode set by parameter 1. In Z mode 0, the full range of Z values sweeps from
short A & D, through short A & long D, through long A & D, through long A & short D, and finally back to short A & D. In
Z mode 1, Z sets the A & D times to the same value, from very short times (about 10ms) to very long times (about 8s).

Output A is the envelope CV, and output B is the VCA output as mentioned above. Each has its own attenuverter parameter,
which can attenuate and/or invert the signal. The maximum envelope level is 10V, with the default parameter value of 32
giving an 8V envelope, which corresponds to unity gain for the VCA. Each output also has an offset parameter, which can
move the whole envelope up or down by up to 10V.

If parameter 2 is set to the special value 41, output A becomes an end-of-cycle trigger output, generating a 10ms 5V
pulse at the end of the envelope's release stage.

Parameters 6 & 7 set the attack and release shapes of the envelope respectively, from an exaggerated exponential curve
at 0 to an almost linear shape at 32.

Pushing the Z knob has the same effect as triggering the envelope via the X input.

**MIDI Input**: Any MIDI note messages received on the MIDI channel set in the Settings trigger the envelope.

This algorithm offers dual two-stage (attack/release or attack/decay)
envelope generators, with shared time settings.

Inputs X & Y are trigger inputs. A signal in excess of 1V on either input will trigger its respective envelope,
according to the mode set by parameter 0. In trigger mode 0, the envelope will rise to full level and stay there as long
as the input is high (AR mode). In trigger mode 1, the envelope will execute one full attack/decay cycle in response to
a trigger input (AD mode). In trigger mode 2, the envelope will continually execute attack/decay cycles as long as the
trigger is high
(looped AD mode).

Z sets the envelope times, according to the mode set by parameter 1. In Z mode 0, the full range of Z values sweeps from
short A & D, through short A & long D, through long A & D, through long A & short D, and finally back to short A & D. In
Z mode 1, Z sets the A & D times to the same value, from very short times (about 10ms) to very long times (about 8s).

A & B are the envelope CV outputs. Each has its own attenuverter parameter, which can attenuate and/or invert the
signal. The maximum envelope level is 10V, with the default parameter value of 32 giving an 8V envelope. Each output
also has an offset parameter, which can move the whole envelope up or down by up to 10V.

Parameters 6 & 7 set the attack and release shapes of the envelope respectively, from an exaggerated exponential curve
at 0 to an almost linear shape at 32.

Pushing the Z knob has the same effect as triggering both envelopes via the X & Y inputs.

**MIDI Input**: Any MIDI note messages received on the MIDI channel set in the Settings trigger envelope A; any MIDI
note messages on the next channel up trigger envelope B.

This algorithm implements a fairly traditional stereo compressor.

X & Y are the stereo audio inputs; A & B are the stereo audio outputs.

The Z knob/CV sets the compression ratio, from 1 (no compression) at fully counterclockwise, to infinity (effectively
limiting rather than compression) at fully clockwise.

Parameter 0 sets the threshold level above which compression applies (in dB).

Parameters 1 & 2 set the attack and release times. The attack time range is approximately 0.1ms-1s; the release time
range is approximately 1ms-3s.

Parameter 3 sets the make-up gain (in dB). If set to -1, the make-up gain is calculated automatically from the threshold
and compression ratio.

Parameter 4 sets a lookahead time, effectively delaying the audio slightly relative to the envelope detection. This can
be used to ensure that sharp transients are not lost during the attack time of the envelope. The maximum lookahead is
about 10ms.

***E-5 Side-chain Compressor***

This algorithm is much the same as E-4 Stereo Compressor above, except that the gain reduction is driven not by the
audio signal itself, but by a side-chain input. Refer to the description of E-4 for explanation of the common parameters
not detailed below.

The Z knob/CV is the side-chain input. If you're using an audio signal here, you'll want to set the knob to its
central (un-illuminated)
position first. However, you can also use Z with any CV to control the gain reduction directly.

Parameter 5 sets the compression ratio, with a range from 1 (no compression) to infinity (effectively limiting rather
than compression).

This algorithm implements a mono compressor with side-chain input.

X is the audio input; A is the audio output.

Y is the side-chain input, which drives the compression amount applied to the audio signal on X.The B output provides a
CV reflecting the amount of gain reduction being applied.

The Z knob/CV sets the compression ratio, from 1 (no compression) at fully counterclockwise, to infinity (effectively
limiting rather than compression) at fully clockwise.

Parameter 0 sets the threshold level above which compression applies (in dB).

Parameters 1 & 2 set the attack and release times. The attack time range is approximately 0.1ms-1s; the release time
range is approximately 1ms-3s.

Parameter 3 sets the make-up gain (in dB). If set to -1, the make-up gain is calculated automatically from the threshold
and compression ratio.

Parameter 4 sets a lookahead time, effectively delaying the audio slightly relative to the envelope detection. This can
be used to ensure that sharp transients are not lost during the attack time of the envelope. The maximum lookahead is
about 10ms.

Parameter 5 allows the side-chain input to be mixed into the audio output. The parameter sets the gain in multiples of
0.5dB (i.e. the maximum is +6dB and the minimum is -40dB, which is treated as -âdB).

This algorithm was designed for interfacing Eurorack (or more generally, any analogue synths using the 1V/octave
standard) with Buchla synths, though it has options to cater for other, non-standard formats.

Input X/Output A convert a pitch CV from the 1V/octave standard to the 1.2V/octave standard by default. The exact
scaling is set by parameters 1 & 2:

scale = 1.0 + 0.002 \* ( parameter 1 ) + 0.0002 \* ( parameters 2 )

Input Y is a gate input, triggering when the level exceeds 1V. From this, a Buchla-format combined gate & trigger is
generated from output B. This is a 4ms pulse at 10V, followed by a sustained gate at 5V.

The Z knob/CV provides a tuning control, with a range of approximately Â±0.5 octaves.

Parameter 0 shifts the X input by whole octaves, equivalent to adding a whole number of Volts to the X CV.

Parameter 3 applies an offset in mV to the A output.

Parameter 4 sets the gate level as (1+the parameter value)% of the 10V trigger pulse. The default

value of 49 therefore gives a 50% gate level i.e. 5V.

This algorithm is for interfacing Buchla synths with Eurorack (or more generally, any analogue synths using the
1V/octave standard).

Input X/Output A convert a pitch CV from the 1.2V/octave standard to the 1V/octave standard.

Input Y is intended to receive a Buchla-format combined trigger & gate signal (typically a 10V trigger pulse followed by
a sustained 5V gate). From this, output B generates just the trigger pulse (at 5V). If you need the gate signal, you can
directly use the Buchla output.

This algorithm is a two-stage (attack/decay) envelope generator, whose overall time is set from an input clock pulse.
The envelope is continuously output (starting on each new clock pulse) unless muted.

Input X is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. The time between rising trigger edges is used
to set the envelope time.

Parameter 0 applies a multiplier to the envelope time, according to the table above.Input Y is a mute input. While this
input is over 1V, the output is forced to 0V.

Z sets the envelope shape, from short attack & long decay, to long attack and short decay.

Parameters 3 & 4 set the attack and decay shapes of the envelope respectively, from an exaggerated exponential curve at
0 to an almost linear shape at 32.

A & B both output the envelope CV. Parameters 1 & 2 are attenuverters, which can attenuate and/or invert the signal for
each output independently. The unattenuated envelope level is 8V.

If parameter 1 is set to the special value 41, output A becomes an end-of-cycle trigger output, generating a 10ms 5V
pulse at the end of the envelope's release stage.

controlled amplifier) function.

Input X is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. The time between rising trigger edges is used
to set the envelope time.

Parameter 0 applies a multiplier to the envelope time, according to the table above.

Input Y is the VCA input. The signal here will be multiplied by the envelope and output on output B.

Z sets the envelope shape, from short attack & long decay, to long attack and short decay.

Parameters 3 & 4 set the attack and decay shapes of the envelope respectively, from an exaggerated exponential curve at
0 to an almost linear shape at 32.

Output A is the envelope CV, and output B is the VCA output as mentioned above. Parameters 1 & 2 are attenuverters,
which can attenuate and/or invert the signal for each output independently. The unattenuated envelope level is 8V;
output B is unity gain with respect to input Y if unattenuated.

If parameter 1 is set to the special value 41, output A becomes an end-of-cycle trigger output, generating a 10ms 5V
pulse at the end of the envelope's release stage.

This algorithm generates random CVs via the popular rotating shift register method. The joy of this method is that it
generates a loop of CVs, with a controllable likelihood of change, including the possibility to lock the loop so it does
not change.

X is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. On each rising edge the shift register rotates and a
new CV is output. On each rotation, there is the possibility that one bit of the shift register will be flipped,
changing the pattern. The likelihood of a flip is set by Z. When Z is zero there is a 50% chance that the bit will flip,
which is the most random setting. As Z rises, the chance of a flip reduces, until at around 2V the chance of a flip hits
zero and the pattern is effectively locked. Conversely, as Z goes negative, the chance of a flip goes up, reaching 100%
at around -2V. This also effectively locks the pattern. When Z crosses the Â±2V boundaries, in either direction, the
display shows "\*\*" for a short while to let you know that the pattern has been locked or unlocked.

Input Y allows for modification of the sequence, even when the loop is locked. If input Y is above 1V, the bit will
always be flipped on a clock pulse, regardless of the setting of Z.

Output A is the random pattern interpreted as a unipolar CV i.e. it is always a positive voltage. Output B is the random
pattern interpreted as a bipolar CV i.e. it can swing both positive and negative.

Parameter 0 sets the direction of rotation. The two directions have a different sound to the patterns they tend to
generate.

Parameter 1 sets the length of the shift register, and so the length of the repeating CV pattern in terms of clocks.

Parameter 2 sets the output slew rate. This has the same effect as the Slew Rate Limiter algorithm being applied to the
outputs.

Parameter 3 is an attenuverter for both outputs.

Parameter 4 is an offset for both outputs.

**MIDI Input:** if parameter 5 is non-zero, incoming MIDI clock advances the shift register, according to the following

Output A is the random pattern of CVs, quantized to the scale chosen via parameter 2. The list of scales is the same as
that for the Quantizer algorithm, above.

Output B is a trigger output.

Parameter 0 sets the direction of rotation. The two directions have a different sound to the patterns they tend to
generate.

Parameter 1 sets the length of the shift register, and so the length of the repeating CV pattern in terms of clocks.

Parameter 3 is an attenuverter for the random CV, applied before quantization.

Parameter 5 is a transpose amount, in semitones, applied after quantization.

Parameter 6 sets the output slew rate. This has the same effect as the Slew Rate Limiter algorithm being applied to
output A.

**MIDI Output**: each new note (i.e. when the Output B trigger fires) is output as a MIDI note message on the MIDI
channel selected in the settings.

**MIDI Input:** if parameter 7 is non-zero, incoming MIDI clock advances the shift register, according to the table

This algorithm generates random triggers via the popular rotating shift register method. The joy of this method is that
it generates a loop of triggers, with a controllable likelihood of change, including the possibility to lock the loop so
it does not change. In this algorithm there are two shift registers for the two outputs, which share a common clock.

X is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. On each rising edge the shift register rotates and a
new CV is output. On each rotation, there is the possibility that one bit of the shift register will be flipped,
changing the pattern. The likelihood of a flip is set by Z. When Z is zero there is a 50% chance that the bit will flip,
which is the most random setting. As Z rises, the chance of a flip reduces, until at around 2V the chance of a flip hits
zero and the pattern is effectively locked. Conversely, as Z goes negative, the chance of a flip goes up, reaching 100%
at around -2V. This also effectively locks the pattern. When Z crosses the Â±2V boundaries, in either direction, the
display shows "\*\*" for a short while to let you know that the pattern has been locked or unlocked.

Input Y allows for modification of the sequence, even when the loop is locked. If input Y is above 1V, the bit will
always be flipped on a clock pulse, regardless of the setting of Z.

Output A & B are the random patterns of triggers. A trigger is emitted on each output for every bit set in that output's
shift register.

Parameters 0 & 1 set the length of the shift registers, and so the length of the repeating trigger patterns in terms of
clocks.

Parameters 2 & 3 set the length of the output pulses. At zero, the pulse is a fixed length of 10ms. Values of 1-31 set
the pulse length to a fraction of the clock time.

**MIDI Input:** if parameter 4 is non-zero, incoming MIDI clock advances the shift register, according to the table

| **Z is trim**     |
| **A is output 1** |
| **B is output 2** |

This algorithm provides a software implementation of the Expert Sleepers module. The in conjunction with the plug-in
this allows you to pass CVs from your DAW to your modular via an AC coupled audio interface.

X & Y are the two inputs - connect these to outputs from your audio interface.

A & B are the corresponding outputs - connect these to CV inputs in your modular.

Z provides a trim control. Adjust this so that a zero CV entering the AC Encoder plug-in gives you a zero CV out of the
disting (either with a voltmeter, or by eye, just looking at the colour of the disting's output jacks).

***G-2 ES-2 Emulation***

This algorithm provides a software implementation of the Expert Sleepers module. The in conjunction with the plug-in
this allows you to pass CVs from your modular into your DAW via a regular audio interface.

X & Y are the two inputs - connect these to CV outputs from your modular.

A & B are the corresponding outputs - connect these to inputs on your audio interface.

Z provides a trim control, allowing adjustment of the ES-2's operating frequency. Start with this at zero (LEDs off) and
adjust to minimise noise in the CV recovered from the plug-in.

Generates sine and square waves at a fixed pitch, specified by the parameters.

Z sets the amplitude of the outputs.

When the pitch is changed, the note name is scrolled across the display, first as a normal name (e.g. 'C\#4') and then
as a MIDI note number
(e.g. 61).

***G-4 Frequency Reference***

| **Z sets the amplitude of A & B** |

Generates sine and square waves at a fixed frequency, specified in Hz.

Z sets the amplitude of the outputs.

When the pitch is changed, the frequency is scrolled across the display
(e.g. '440Hz').This algorithm uses an interface unlike any other, in order to be able to set the digits of the frequency
individually. It is somewhat like the usual parameters interface, in that pressing Z advances through the digits, and
turning S changes the values.

When S is turned, a pair of digits is displayed. The first is the decimal place that is being edited in the frequency
value e.g. '0' is ones, '1' is tens, '2' is hundreds and so on. The second digit is the value of that digit within the
frequency value.

Pressing Z advances the decimal place, and displays a pair of digits as above representing that new part of the
frequency value, which can then be edited with S.

***G-5 Tuner***

| **A is a copy of X**                      |
| **B is a sine wave at the tracked pitch** |
| **Z sets the amplitude of B**             |

This algorithm provides a chromatic tuner. The pitch of the input signal is tracked and displayed as a note name, with
indication of whether the note is sharp or flat.

Natural notes are shown in capitals i.e. 'C', 'D', 'E' etc. Lower case letters indicate sharps e.g. 'c' indicates C
sharp, 'd', indicates D sharp.

Following the note name a '-' indicates that the note is below the true pitch (flat) and '+' indicates that the note is
above the true pitch
(sharp). If the note is within 1 cent of the true pitch, neither '-' nor
'+' is shown.

Output A is a copy of X, so the tuner can be left inline without needing a mult.

Output B is a sine wave at the pitch of the detected note. The amplitude of the sine wave is set by the Z knob/CV.

***G-6 Clock***

When enabled, the Z input/pot controls the multiplier. When Z is at
0V, the clock output is suppressed; higher voltages give higher
multipliers. If you prefer a 0V CV input to correspond to 1x
multiplier instead of stopping the clock, simply turn Z slightly
clockwise to bias the input positive.

Performs a MIDI to CV conversion on MIDI notes arriving on the disting's MIDI port.The received MIDI channel is selected
in the settings.

Parameter 6 sets the mode of operation.

In mode 0: Output A is the pitch CV output; output B is the gate output.

In mode 1: Output A is the pitch CV output; output B is another pitch CV output using the next MIDI channel up.

Outputs A & B can also be controlled directly via MIDI CCs 33 & 34 respectively (the CC range of 0-127 is mapped to -5V
to +5V), or via MIDI CCs 35 & 36 (the CC range of 0-127 is mapped to 0V to 10V).

Parameter 2 selects a scale to use, if any are provided on the SD card. See âScala Supportâ above. The default value of
-1 disables this function.

Parameter 3 enables a 'fingered portamento' effect, that is, a glide from one note to the next if they are played
legato. Higher parameter values give a slower glide.

Parameter 4 enables an interruption of the gate output when notes are played legato. The parameter value sets the time
in milliseconds to send the gate low when a new note is played.

Parameter 5 sets the note priority mode. The options are Last, Low, and High.

Generates MIDI notes (on the MIDI channel selected in the settings) from the pitch and gate CVs on the X & Y inputs.

Parameter 0 sets an offset between the timing of the X & Y inputs (in sample frames). It is generally a good idea to
delay the pitch slightly relative to the gate, to ensure that the pitch has changed and settled before the gate triggers
a new note.

Parameter 1 chooses the function of the Z knob/CV. If 0, Z sets the velocity of the generated MIDI notes. Otherwise, Z
generates CC messages using the parameter value as the CC number, and the note velocity is fixed at 64.

Parameters 2 & 3, when non-zero, allow you to generate CC messages from the X & Y inputs (using the parameter value as
the CC number). If Y is to be converted to a CC, then notes are no longer generated.

Viewed as a stereo output, A & B provide a panned version of X, plus an oppositely panned version of Y.

Viewed as mono outputs, A provides a crossfaded mix of X & Y, while B provides a mix with an inverted mix control.

In both cases Z provides the pan position or crossfade amount. When Z is turned, the crossfade position is displayed as
a percentage (so 50% is an equal mix of the two sources/centre pan).

Parameter 3 attenuates output B (in all modes).

**FX Loop usage**

A combination of parameters 0 and 2 can be used to set up the disting as an effect loop controller, to integrate
external effect units (e.g. pedals, rack processors) into the modular.

Use input X as the main signal input. Setting parameter 2 to -1 makes output B a copy of the input, attenuated by
parameter 3, which can be sent to the effects unit.

Return the effected signal to input Y. There are then two options for how you want to mix in the effect. With parameter
0 at 0, 1, or 2, the Z knob/CV gives you a wet/dry mix control. With parameter 0 at 3, the amount of input X in the mix
is constant, so Z gives you a simple fader on the effect return.

**If parameter 0 is 0 (the default)**:  
Output A is a sample of input X, taken when the trigger input Z goes over 1V. (Sample and Hold) **If parameter 0 is
1**:  
Output A follows input X while input Z is over 1V. When Z falls below 0.5V, output A is held until Z goes over 1V
again. (Track and Hold)

Similarly for output B/input Y.

Pressing the Z knob triggers a sample manually.

Parameter 1 sets an offset between the timing of the X/Y & Z inputs (in sample frames). If X/Y & Z are being driven
together, for example by a sequencer's pitch and gate, it is often a good idea to delay the trigger slightly to allow
time for the sampled CV to settle before the sample is taken.

Parameters 2 & 3 add white noise into the signal from inputs X & Y respectively, allowing you to use the algorithm as a
source of random voltages without having to patch anything into the inputs.

Parameters 4 & 5 control the amount of slew applied to outputs A & B respectively.

Output A is a quantized version of input X; the closest whole-semitone value to the unquantized V/octave pitch CV X.
Similarly output B is a quantized version of input Y.

As well as providing a chromatic scale, this algorithm can also constrain the quantized values to a musical scale or
chord. This is controlled by the Z knob/CV.

When Z changes, the scale is displayed on the LEDs. The scale's number in the following table is shown, and after a
short pause, the scale's name.

| **Number** | **Scale**            | **Displayed name** |

| 15         | harmonic minor scale | Harm Minor         |

For each quantizer, a parameter provides a transpose control. The transposition is applied to the input before it is
forced into the chosen scale i.e. the transposition moves the notes around within the same key.

The quantized notes names are shown on the display (A left, B right). Natural notes are shown in capitals i.e. 'C', '
D', 'E' etc. Lower case letters indicate sharps e.g. 'c' indicates C sharp, 'd', indicates D sharp.

**MIDI Output**: each new note is output as a MIDI note message on the MIDI channel selected in the settings (input
X/output A) or on the next highest channel (input Y/output B). E.g. if the settings specify MIDI channel 4, the notes
are output on channels 4 (X/A) and 5 (Y/B).

Output A is a quantized version of input X; the closest whole-semitone value to the unquantized V/octave pitch CV X.
Similarly output B is a quantized version of input Y.

As well as providing a chromatic scale, this algorithm can also constrain the quantized values to a musical scale or
chord. This is controlled by parameters 2 & 3.

Additionally, the parameter being positive or negative controls whether the quantizer works in triggered mode or not.
The triggers are provided by input Z (approximately 1V is required to trigger it). If the parameter is negative, the
quantizer is triggered - the input is only sampled and converted to a new quantized value when triggered by input Z. If
the parameter is positive, the input is constantly sampled and a new note is output as soon as the input moves into the
next semitone range.

If the scale selected is 'MIDI 1' or 'MIDI 2' (values 17 & 18) the
candidate notes for quantization are set via MIDI. The algorithm
listens for MIDI note on messages and uses the received notes for the
quantization pattern. While any notes are held, playing new notes adds
to the pattern. When all notes are released and a new note played, the
pattern is reset and formed from the new note.
>
In 'MIDI 1' mode the played MIDI notes set the note names, but
quantization can happen in any octave (i.e. if you play a 'D' the
output will always be 'D' but the octave will depend on the octave of
the incoming CV).
>
In 'MIDI 2' mode the played MIDI notes are the only ones that can be
output (so say if you play middle C and the D above, the output will
always be one of those two notes, depending on whether the input CV is
below or above middle C).
>
The quantized notes names are shown on the display (A left, B right).
Natural notes are shown in capitals i.e. 'C', 'D', 'E' etc. Lower case
letters indicate sharps e.g. 'c' indicates C sharp, 'd', indicates D
sharp.
>
**MIDI Output**: each new note is output as a MIDI note message on the
MIDI channel selected in the settings (input X/output A) or on the
next highest channel (input Y/output B). E.g. if the settings specify
MIDI channel 4, the notes are output on channels 4 (X/A) and 5 (Y/B).
>
The MIDI Gate parameter works in the same way as for the Quantizer,
above.

This algorithm generates rhythmic patterns of output pulses known as
Euclidean patterns. For a detailed description of these patterns and
how they are commonly found in music around the world see e.g. 9 or
10.
>
A pattern is described by the total number of steps (controlled by
parameter 0) and the number of pulses (i.e. the number steps on which
a pulse is output) (controlled by parameter 1 for output A and by Z
for output B).

be a pulse, and the remaining pulses distributed according to the algorithm. The rotation setting moves the first pulse
by a number of steps i.e. moves the down beat.

The two patterns can use the same rotation value, or independent values. If parameter 4 is -1, pattern 2 shares the
rotation value set by parameter 2. Otherwise, it uses the rotation set by parameter 4.

Parameter 3 sets the length of the output pulse. At zero, the pulse is a fixed length of 10ms. Values of 1-31 set the
pulse length to a fraction of the clock time.

Parameter 5 sets the overall repeat count i.e. the number of clocks until the pattern repeats. If this is zero, the
number of steps
(parameter 0) is used as the repeat. If the repeat count is greater than the number of steps, the pattern is extended
with silence.

Input X is the clock input, advancing the pattern by one step each time the input exceeds 1V. Input Y is a reset input,
resetting the pattern to step 1.

**MIDI Input:** if parameter 6 is non-zero, the patterns are controlled by incoming MIDI clock. If the parameter is
positive, the patterns simply advance according to the clock divisor table above. If the parameter is negative, the
patterns are also locked in to the MIDI transport: the pattern position depends absolutely on the number of clocks since
the last MIDI start message (and so is predictable and repeatable).

Outputs A & B are pulse generators (0-5V) triggered by inputs X & Y respectively (1V required to trigger). The delay
between the trigger and the output pulse, and the length of the pulse, can both be controlled.

Unless in a mode where they are set by the Z input/CV, the delay and length are set from parameters 2 & 3. Parameter 1
provides a range control, which scales both the delay and length times. When the range parameter is 0, the maximum time
is 10ms. Higher settings for range progressively double the maximum time; at the maximum ranage setting of 12, the
maximum time is therefore 40.96s.

Parameter 0 controls the function of Z:

Dual output variable-colour noise generator, with two optional VCAs.Outputs A and B are noise, with colour according to
the parameter values:

| **Parameter value** | **Noise colour** |
|---------------------|------------------|
| -1                  | Blended          |
| 0                   | Violet           |

| 3                   | Red              |

If 'blended' is chosen, the noise colour can be smoothly swept from violet to red with the Z knob/CV.

Parameters 2 & 3 set the attenuation of the outputs (31 corresponds to Â±8V output for white noise).

If the parameter is set to -1, the corresponding X/Y input is used to set the output amplitude (equivalent to following
the noise output with a VCA driven by X/Y). The X/Y inputs are clamped at 0V i.e. negative input voltages yield silence.

The imaginatively-named Quantizer 2 algorithm offers pitch quantization to musical scales, with real-time user control
over the notes in the scale to quantize to, and with two CV outputs that can be offset by a musical interval (e.g. a
third, a fifth, an octave etc.).

X is the pitch CV input. Parameter 3 allows you to attenuate the signal before it is quantized.

Y is either a second pitch CV input, simply added to X, or a trigger input. When it is a pitch input, it is added to X
after X has been attenuated â the attenuation parameter does not affect Y.

Parameter 4 controls the function of Y. When the parameter is in the range -32 to 0, Y is a CV input, attenuated by the
parameter (so -32 means no attenuation, -16 means 50%, and 0 means complete attenuation). When the parameter is 1-32 Y
is a trigger input, and the parameter defines an offset (in sample frames) between the timing of the X & Y inputs. It is
often a good idea to delay the trigger slightly relative to the pitch, to ensure that the pitch has changed and settled
before the trigger samples a new note.

A & B are the quantized pitch CV outputs. The Z knob/CV controls an interval between the two CVs, applied to output B.
The interval is specified in scale degrees, so for example '3' is a third, and '8' is an octave. 'U' is displayed for
unison. Note that this is not simply a constant voltage offset between the outputs â the voltage difference changes
according to the position in the scale. For example, if the interval is a third, in C major, and output A is C (0V),
then output B will be E (0.333V, a difference of 0.333V); if output A is D (0.167V), output B will be F (0.417V, a
difference of 0.25V).

Parameter 5 sets a slew rate for both outputs. At a value of 0 there is no slew; larger values apply increasingly more
slew.

Parameter 1 chooses the scale. The available options are:

Parameter 2 sets the key to quantize into. The displayed key names
assume that 0V pitch CV corresponds to the note C. The parameter value
does not represent semitones, but degrees around the circle of fifths.
Equivalently, the parameter indicates the number of sharps or flats:

| **Parameter value** | **Key** | **Parameter value** | **Key** |
|---------------------|---------|---------------------|---------|
| -5                  | Dâ­      | 0                   | C       |

Parameter 0 defines the quantizer pattern â the selection of notes
from the scale that are available for the CV to adopt. The user
interface to editing the pattern is unique to this algorithm. When
parameter 0 is the current parameter, turning the S knob scrolls
through the degrees of the scale e.g.
>
from 1 to 7 for a major scale. (The actual notes that these scale
degrees refer to depend on the selected key and scale.) Next to the
number of the scale degree is either a '+', which indicates the degree
is included in the quantizer pattern, or '.', which indicates that it
is not. Pressing the S knob toggles between these two states.
>
When the display is not showing a parameter value or name, it shows
the note name of the pitch CV on output A (assuming, as mentioned
above, that 0V corresponds to a C).
>
**MIDI Input**: MIDI note messages received on MIDI channel 1 or 2 set
the quantizer pattern. The notes of the C major scale (i.e. the white
keys) turn on & off the corresponding degrees of the pattern. Note
that C major is always used for the MIDI input, regardless of which
key the quantizer is actually working in. The octave of the MIDI notes
makes no difference. How the notes control the pattern depends on the
MIDI channel:

| â   | MIDI channel 1: A note on message toggles the state of the degree in the pattern on or off. |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| â   | â MIDI channel 2: The pattern is set from the notes currently being held down.              |

This algorithm continuously plays audio files, in a manner very much
inspired by Tom Whitwell's module.

The current audio file is selected with the Z knob/CV. It plays, forever, at its natural speed (see the algorithms below
if you want to control the speed), looping when it gets to the end; or it plays until the end of the file and stops,
depending on the 'loop' setting.

X is a retrigger input. A trigger pulse in excess of 1V will reset the playback position. The initial playback position
is set by the Y input. The voltage range 0-8V corresponds to the length of the file so e.g. 0V input (or no input) sets
the initial position to the start of the file, 4V input sets the initial position to halfway through the file, etc.

When switching between files, the playback position is maintained, modulo the length of the new file. For example, if
you're 5 seconds into a 10 second file:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>â¢</th>
<th>
if you switch to a 20 second file, the position will be 5 seconds into the new file.
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>â¢</td>
<td>
if you switch to a 2 second file, the position will be 1 second into the new file.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

(Though see the 'useStartOnSampleChange' playlist option above to override this behaviour.)A & B are the left & right
audio outputs respectively.

Parameter 0 chooses the sample folder. These are sorted alphabetically, or in the order specified in the playlist, if
one is provided.

Parameter 1 sets the trigger mode and envelope time. If the parameter is 0, the trigger input is simply that â only a
positive-going edge is used, to retrigger the sample. If the parameter is 1 or more, then the trigger input is treated
like a gate: a positive-going edge retriggers the sample, but also when the trigger CV goes low, the sample playback
stops. The value of the parameter specifies the length of a decay envelope that is applied to the sample, so it can stop
suddenly or gradually fade out.

**MIDI Input**: MIDI note on & off messages are handled equivalently to a trigger or gate on the X input â that is, a
note on retriggers the sample, and if the envelope time is non-zero, a note off will stop the playback.

This algorithm plays audio files, the speed of which is set by incoming clock pulses.

The current audio file is selected with the Z knob/CV, if parameter 2 is -1, or by the parameter itself, if it is in the
range 0-99.

X is a retrigger input. A trigger pulse in excess of 1V will reset the playback position to the start of the sample, if
Z is being used to select the sample, or to the position set by Z (the full range of Z, approximately -5V to 5V,
corresponds to the length of the sample).

Y is the clock input. The speed of the sample playback is adjusted so
that the whole sample fits into the time taken for a number of clocks,
where that number is set (per sample) in the playlist.

When switching between files, the playback position is maintained, as
for the I-1Audio Playback algorithm.

**MIDI Input**: MIDI note on & off messages are handled equivalently
to a trigger or gate on the X input â that is, a note on retriggers
the sample, and if the envelope time is non-zero, a note off will stop
the playback. Additionally, the pitch of the note on message is used
instead of the Y input CV, so you can effectively play the disting
like a sampler from a MIDI keyboard. MIDI note 48 (C3) corresponds to
a 0V input i.e. playing the sample at its natural pitch. MIDI pitch
bend is supported; parameter 4 sets the bend depth in semitones.
>
Parameter 3 'MIDI mode' allows for polyphonic operation, using
multiple disting mk4 modules. If the parameter is -1 or 0, the module
responds to MIDI like a monophonic synthesizer11. Otherwise, the
parameter is a 'voice ID' in a polyphonic setup. By giving different
voice IDs to multiple

11 It is the intention that in future MIDI modes -1 and 0 might
differ, for example in reusing the CV inputs that are

likely not used if you're controlling the module via MIDI, but
currently they are the same.

distings, and feeding them the same MIDI, you can create a polyphonic sample player where each disting takes a different
note of a held chord.

(Recall that the Select Bus provides a convenient way to send the same MIDI to multiple distings without extra cabling -
see above.)

By default the polyphonic operation uses a 'lowest voice' allocation scheme â each new note is allocated to the voice
with the lowest ID that is not currently playing a note. It is also possible to select a 'round robin' allocation
scheme, which often works better with samples with a decay tail. This is done by sending MIDI CC \#21 with a value of
the number of polyphonic voices available. Sending this CC also resets the round robin to voice 1 (you may like to do
this at the start of a song playback, for example, to ensure consistent results on each play). Sending CC \#21 with
value 0 reverts to lowest voice allocation.

This algorithm is much the same as the 'I-1 Audio Playback' algorithm, except that it forgoes voltage control of the
current sample and instead offers a speed control.

Z is the linear speed control. The central position corresponds to the sample playing at its natural pitch. Positive
voltages speed up playback; negative voltages slow it down. Because the scale is linear it is possible to slow it down
all the way to being stopped.

The current sample is selected via parameter 1.

Parameters 0 & 2 are the standard sample folder and envelope time parameters, described above.**MIDI Input**: MIDI note
on & off messages are handled equivalently to a trigger or gate on the X input â that is, a note on retriggers the

Similar to âI-4 Audio Playback with Z Speedâ except that the playback speed is allowed to go negative i.e. the sample
can play backwards. Playback speed is linear with Z, with a maximum of around 2x speed, and with 0V/center Z
corresponding to a speed of zero.

Input Y selects the sample. Parameter 1 is added to input Y, so you can effectively use either or a combination of both
to select the sample. Note that in this algorithm a maximum of 50 samples are accessible, not the usual 100.

The algorithm caches a reversed copy of each sample to the MicroSD card. It does this once only for each sample, when it
finds a new sample or one that has changed. This may take a few seconds, during which time the message âProcessing...â
scrolls across the display. Do not remove the MicroSD card or turn off the disting during this time, in case the MicroSD
card becomes corrupted.

Parameters 0 & 2 are the standard sample folder and envelope time parameters, described above.

**MIDI Input**: MIDI note on & off messages are handled equivalently to a trigger or gate on the X input â that is, a
note on retriggers the sample, and if the envelope time is non-zero, a note off will stop the playback.

In this algorithm the sample playback position is directly driven from the Y input. Imagine a piece of audio tape
passing over a tape head â in other algorithms, that tape is constantly moving at some speed or other as if driven by a
motor, but in this algorithm you're basically dragging the tape back and forwards over the playhead yourself.

Parameter 1 sets a limit on the speed at which the audio can play. With long samples or rapidly changing Y inputs it is
easy to demand very high playback speeds, and this parameter enables you to put a cap on that.

Parameter 2 sets a slew limit, effectively putting a low-pass filter on the Y input. This is useful particularly when
using a manually-generated CV to remove any âtwitchinessâ.

Parameter 3 sets an offset on the Y input, essentially adding or subtracting a constant voltage.

The algorithm caches a reversed copy of each sample to the MicroSD card. It does this once only for each sample, when it
finds a new sample or one that has changed. This may take a few seconds, during which time the message âProcessing...â
scrolls across the display. Do not remove the MicroSD card or turn off the disting during this time, in case the MicroSD
card becomes corrupted.

Parameter 0 is the standard sample folder parameter, described above.

This algorithm simultaneously plays two audio files, each with its own trigger input. It was developed particularly with
drum triggering in mind, but all the usual playback options are supported. For drum applications, the preferred playlist
options are:

<table>

<tr class="odd">
<td>
-loop=0<br />
-gap=0<br />
-fadeIn=0<br />
-fadeOut=0<br />
-retriggerOnSampleChange=0

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The Z knob/input selects the samples, in pairs â the sample triggered by the X input is always an even-numbered sample,
and the Y input triggers the next sample up.

Parameter 1 selects between two options for how the outputs are used:

Parameters 0 & 2 are the standard sample folder and envelope time parameters, described above.

The triggers are 'velocity sensitive' â the volume of the sample depends on the voltage of the trigger pulse.

**MIDI Input**: MIDI note on & off messages are handled equivalently to a trigger or gate on the X & Y inputs â that is,
a note on retriggers the sample, and if the envelope time is non-zero, a note off

will stop the playback. MIDI note 48 (C3) triggers sample A; note 49 triggers sample B.

Similar to âI-7 Dual Audio Playbackâ except that the sample playback speed is controlled by the Z knob/CV input.

The two samples are selected by parameters 1 & 2.

Parameter 3 selects the panning option â refer to the description in the algorithm above.

Parameter 4 selects which samples are affected by the speed control, as follows:

Parameters 0 & 5 are the standard sample folder and envelope time parameters, described above.

The triggers are 'velocity sensitive' â the volume of the sample depends on the voltage of the trigger pulse.

**MIDI Input**: MIDI note on & off messages are handled equivalently to a trigger or gate on the X & Y inputs â that is,
a note on retriggers the sample, and if the envelope time is non-zero, a note off will stop the playback. MIDI note 48 (
C3) triggers sample A; note 49 triggers sample B.

Algorithm-specific playlist filename: midi-playlist-clocked.txt

This algorithm plays MIDI files, converting the MIDI into CV outputs on A & B (as detailed above).

The current MIDI file is selected with the Z knob/CV, if parameter 0 is -1, or by the parameter itself if it is in the
range 0-31, in which case Z is not used.

The X input is a clock, which controls the speed of the MIDI file playback. A clock pulse should exceed 1V. The clocks
correspond to quarter notes in the MIDI file.

Y is a retrigger input. A trigger pulse in excess of 1V will reset the file to the beginning.**MIDI Output**: the MIDI
file being played is transmitted unaltered on the disting's MIDI output.

This algorithm plays audio files, using a 1V/octave pitch input (Y) to both select the sample and control its pitch.
This would typically be used for playing a multisampled instrument across a range of pitches, or for mapping individual
sounds (e.g. drums) to different notes.

This is a dual version of the Multisample Audio Playback algorithm below. Two voices play at once; they can play
continuously, but a more typical use would be to use the envelope time parameter to have notes decay when the gate
closes â then, this being a dual algorithm, one note can

continue to decay while the next one starts.
>
The other main difference between this and the monophonic Multisample
Audio Playback algorithm is in the behaviour of the pitch CV input. In
the monophonic algorithm the pitch CV is used to choose the sample
when triggered, but also continues to be 'live' during the playback,
allowing bends, vibrato etc. In this dual algorithm, the pitch CV is
sampled when the playback is triggered; subsequent CV change has no
effect until it moves by more than a semitone, in which case a new
note is triggered.
>
X is a retrigger input. A trigger pulse in excess of 1V will reset the
playback position to the start of the sample. The trigger is 'velocity
sensitive' â the volume of the sample depends on the voltage of the
trigger pulse.
>
The Z knob/CV provides a tuning control, with a range of approximately
Â±0.5 octaves. Note that this is applied after the sample has been
selected using the Y CV; changing Z will not affect the sample
selection.
>
A & B are the left & right audio outputs respectively.
>
Parameter 1 shifts the pitch up or down in octave increments. It is
equivalent to offsetting the pitch CV input â it also affects the
sample selection.
>
Parameters 0 & 2 are the standard sample folder and envelope time
parameters, described above.
>
Parameter 6 offsets (delays) the retrigger/gate input relative to the
pitch input. This is useful to allow pitch CVs to settle before they
are sampled on the rising gate, and also to cope with modules which
output both a pitch and gate but change their pitch first. In both
cases, an offset allows the algorithm to choose the correct sample,
rather than choosing the wrong sample and then re-pitching it to match
the CV.
>
**MIDI Input**: MIDI note on & off messages are handled equivalently
to a trigger or gate on the X input â that is, a note on retriggers
the sample, and if the envelope time is non-zero, a note off will stop
the playback. Additionally, the pitch of the note on message is used
instead of the Y input CV, so you can effectively play the disting
like a sampler from a MIDI keyboard. MIDI note 48 (C3) corresponds to
a 0V input. MIDI pitch bend is supported; parameter 4 sets the bend
depth in semitones.
>
Parameter 3 'MIDI mode' works in the same way as for algorithm I-3 â
see above.
>
Parameter 5 sets the sample panning as in the Dual Audio Playback
algorithm above. This algorithm defaults the setting to 1 so that the
two voices are summed, but setting it to zero can give you some nice
stereo effects where alternate notes are panned oppositely.

Algorithm-specific playlist filename: midi-playlist-free.txt  
This algorithm plays MIDI files, converting the MIDI into CV outputs on A & B (as detailed above).

The current MIDI file is selected via the parameter i.e. by turning the S knob.

The playback speed is set by a combination of the Z knob/CV and the X CV. With both at zero, the MIDI file plays at
120bpm. Z offers a linear speed control - positive voltages speed up playback; negative voltages slow it down. Because
the scale is linear it is possible to slow it down all the way to being stopped. X offers an exponential (1V/octave)
speed control - the speed doubles for every 1V above zero, and halves for every 1V below zero.

Y is a retrigger input. A trigger pulse in excess of 1V will reset the file to the beginning.**MIDI Output**: the MIDI
file being played is transmitted unaltered on the disting's MIDI output.

When Z is adjusted through the switching point between these two modes, the display will show "Xt" or "Zt" (for X
trigger or Z trigger) for a short while.

The current sample is selected via parameter 1.

Parameters 0 & 2 are the standard sample folder and envelope time parameters, described above.**MIDI Input**: MIDI note
on & off messages are handled equivalently to a trigger or gate on the X input â that is, a note on retriggers the
sample, and if the envelope time is non-zero, a note off will stop the playback.

This algorithm records the incoming audio to a WAV file on the MicroSD
card.
>
X & Y are the audio inputs. The incoming audio is echoed directly to
the A & B outputs.
>
The Z knob/CV controls recording. When Z exceeds approximately 1V,
recording starts. When it falls below 0.5V, recording stops. If Z
already exceeds 1V when the algorithm is started, it must fall below
0.5V before recording can be started for the first time.

| Do not remove the MicroSD card or power off the disting while recording is active, |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| as this could corrupt the card.                                                    |

The recorded WAV files are stereo, 16 bit, 46.875kHz. The files are
named sequentially starting with REC00000.WAV (then REC00001.WAV,
REC00002.WAV etc.). If there are already recordings on the card, the
next available filename will be used; the old files will not be
overwritten.
>
The files are placed in a folder named '!RECORD'12. If this folder
does not exist, it will be created.
>
When recording is complete, a small text file will also be written to
the card, with the same filename but with the extension '.TXT'. This
will detail any dropouts that occurred while recording the file (or
ideally simply 'No dropouts').
>
The disting's screen shows different information than the usual
algorithm name or parameter values in this mode. The left two columns
of LEDs display level meters for the two audio inputs. The right
section of the screen either shows a rectangle (for recording stopped)
or a recording animation (when recording).
>
12 The thinking behind this slightly odd name is that it places it
alphabetically before any folder beginning with a letter, and so it is
likely to be the first folder in the list when switching to a playback
algorithm â so if you want to rapidly switch from record to playback,
you don't have to scroll through a list of folders.

a 0V input. MIDI pitch bend is supported; parameter 4 sets the bend
depth in semitones.

Parameter 3 'MIDI mode' works in the same way as for algorithm I-3 â
see above.

**Multisample playlists**
>
As with other algorithms, playlist files are optional, but you will
almost certainly want to use playlists within the folders to specify
the ânaturalâ and âswitchâ settings that determine the mapping of
samples onto pitch.
>
Within a folder, if the files looked like this:  
<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image7.png" style="width:3.63333in;height:1.24861in" />
>
then "playlist.txt" might contain

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>
disting playlist v1<br />
-loop=0<br />
-retriggerOnSampleChange=0<br />
thumbf2.wav<br />
-natural=41<br />
thumbc3.wav<br />
-switch=44<br />
-natural=48<br />
thumbg3.wav<br />
-switch=52<br />
-natural=55<br />
thumbe4.wav<br />
-switch=60<br />
-natural=64
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

In this case we've turned off looping (the files are quite percussive
thumb piano samples) and turned off retriggerOnSampleChange, so a new
sample is chosen only when a trigger is received.
>
Each sample file uses the â-naturalâ setting to let the algorithm know
its 'natural pitch', that is, the pitch of the audio in the sample as
recorded. The setting uses MIDI note numbers, where 48 is C3 (see for
example 13). For example the file 'thumbf2.wav' is a recording of an F
at 87.3Hz, so its natural pitch is 41.
>
The â-switchâ setting tells the algorithm when to choose one sample
over another. Again, MIDI note numbers are used. The files are
arranged in order of ascending pitch, and the â-switchâ setting
specifies the lowest pitch that will use that file. In the example
above, thumbf2.wav will be used up to MIDI note 43, then thumbc3.wav
up to note 51, thumbg3.wav from 52-59, and finally  
thumbe4.wav for notes 60 and up.
>
With this in mind, the pitch CV is used as follows. The incoming CV is
converted to a MIDI note number â say 49, Câ¯3. First the sample is
looked up based on the switch settings â here 49 will choose
thumbc3.wav. This file has natural pitch of 48, so it will be pitched
up 1 semitone to play at the desired pitch.
>
13 https://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/notes.html

The default for â-switchâ is one up from the previous file in the
list. This makes it convenient to simply list files which are to be
mapped onto neighbouring keys e.g.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>
disting playlist v1<br />
-loop=0<br />
-retriggerOnSampleChange=0<br />
-fixedPitch=1.0<br />
GM KICK BASS.wav<br />
-switch=48<br />
GM MED SNARE.wav<br />
GM CLOSED HH.wav<br />
GM OPEN HH .wav<br />
GM PEDAL HH .wav
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Here five drum samples are mapped onto the five notes from 48 up. Note
we've also here specified â-fixedPitch=1.0â so that the drums are
always played at their natural speed.
>
***J-7 Mono Audio Recorder***
>
This algorithm is identical to 'J-5 Audio Recorder' except that the
files recorded are in mono, using the left (X) input, and the files
are placed in a folder named '!RECORD1'.
>
This can be useful when intending to use the recorded audio in the
disting's own playback modes, since mono samples place less stress on
the SD card throughput, and can be re-pitched higher.

The *raison d'Ãªtre* of this algorithm is creating smooth textural
loops out of any source material14. It is particularly useful for
material captured by the disting's own Audio Recorder modes, which
won't have carefully edited loop points. It can also take a clock and
adjust the loop time to fit.
>
In this algorithm, the playlist settings 'loop', 'fadeIn', 'fadeOut',
and 'gap' are ignored.
>
14 Expert Sleepers have long had a love affair with crossfade sample
looping. Our plug-in Crossfade Loop Synth dates back to 2004 () and is
itself inspired by the Roland S-330 hardware sampler (), with which we
made a lot of music in the early '90s.

X is a gate or clock input, depending on the parameter 3, 'Gate mode':

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Parameter value</strong></th>
<th><strong>Gate mode</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Note that with nothing plugged in to X, switching between modes 0 & 1 gives you a means to start and stop playback
manually.

Input Y is a pitch CV input following the 1V/octave standard. Note that pitching up a crossfaded sample places great
demands on the SD card throughput, and there is a limit to how high you can raise the pitch. In our tests, stereo files
can only be raised by about a fourth. Mono files can be played at considerably higher pitches.

The Z knob/CV selects the sample. The transition from one sample to the next is a smooth crossfade. Note that if the
sample has the
'retriggerOnSampleChange' option set to 0, changing Z will not change the sample â it will only change when playback is
stopped and restarted
(by the X CV or manually via parameter 3).

A & B are the left & right audio outputs respectively.

Parameter 0 is the standard sample folder parameter, described above.

Parameter 1 shifts the pitch up & down by octaves. (Note the comments above on how high the pitch may be raised.)

Parameter 2 sets the crossfade time, in percent of the sample time.

This algorithm is a wavetable VCO. See for example for a brief overview of wavetable synthesis.

X is the pitch input for the VCO, with a 1V/octave response. The 0V point for the pitch input is C3 (approximately
130.81Hz).

The Z knob/CV provides a tuning control, with a range of approximately Â±0.5 octaves.

The Y input controls the lookup point in the wavetable, with a range of Â±5V covering the whole table. Parameter 2
offsets the Y CV, effectively providing a means of manual wave selection.

Output A is the main output of the wavetable VCO.

Output B generates a signal according to parameters 3 and 4. If parameter 4 is -1 (the default), the output is as
follows:

If parameter 4 is 0-99, output B is a copy of output A with a fixed phase offset as defined by the parameter, scaled so
0-128 corresponds to a phase of 0-360Â°. (So for example if you want quadrature outputs, set the phase to 32.)

**MIDI Input**: MIDI note messages received on the MIDI channel set in the Settings are converted to a CV which is added
to that on input X. The 0V note is 48 (C3). MIDI notes also drive the 'MIDI gate' output option.

**Loading wavetables**  
All wavetable files need to be in a top-level folder on the SD card
called 'wavetables'.
>
Within the 'wavetables' folder, wavetables can take of one two forms:
a single WAV file containing all the waveforms concatenated, or a
folder of WAV files, one per waveform.
>
By default the disting will consider all WAV files and folders of WAV
files in the 'wavetables' folder as wavetables. Optionally (say if you
want to reorder the tables) you can specify a playlist: the wavetables
are then listed in the standard playlist format as above, but with the
dedicated name "playlist-wavetable.txt". Each entry is either a WAV
file (as in the other playlist formats), in which case the file is
assumed to contain all the waveforms concatenated, or a folder name.
>
If a folder is specified in "playlist-wavetable.txt", the folder
contains the individual WAV files that represent one waveform each.
The algorithm does not use any 'playlist.txt' file within the folder â
any files found files are used in alphabetical order.
>
Waveform WAVs must be in 16 bit mono format. The sample rate is
unimportant, since the file is assumed to contain exactly one cycle
and so can pitched arbitrarily.
>
When using a single concatenated WAV file, the disting needs to be
know how many frames in the file make up one waveform. This is
specified in the playlist via the -wavelength setting (default 600).
There are no settings that apply to wavetable folders, nor to the
individual files inside the folders.
>
To reiterate â the use of playlists is entirely optional if your
wavetables are in the form of folders of individual waveform files.15
>
A typical SD card might look like this:

<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image8.png" style="width:6.69306in;height:2.85833in" />

15 This applies from firmware version 4.11 onwards.

An example using a concatenated wavetable file would look like this:  
<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image9.png" style="width:6.69306in;height:2.85833in" />

where "playlist-wavetable.txt" contains

<tr class="odd">

PPG_wavetable_01.wav<br />
-wavelength=256<br />
AKWF_0001<br />
AKWF_0002
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The first entry 'PPG\_wavetable\_01.wav' is used as a single WAV file containing concatenated wave cycles, each of
length 256 frames. The remaining entries are taken as folders of individual wave samples.

This algorithm offers a wavetable oscillator intended for LFO use, though with an audio rate clock it can also be used
at audio frequencies. Consider it a combination of the Wavetable VCO and the Clockable LFO.

See 'Loading wavetables' above for a description of how to load wavetables onto the SD card.

Input X is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. The time between rising trigger edges is used
to set the cycle time.

The Y input controls the lookup point in the wavetable, with a range of Â±5V covering the whole

table. Parameter 1 offsets the Y CV, effectively providing a means of manual wave selection.

The Z knob/CV sets a scale factor which is applied to the cycle time. The scale is an integer (whole number) which
either multiplies or divides the frequency, and ranges in value from 1-16.

When Z changes, the scale is shown on the display. If the value shown is negative, it is a divisor rather than a
multiplier. Note that there is no value of "-1" since dividing by 1 and multiplying by 1 are the same.

Outputs A & B are the result of the wavetable lookup. Each output has its own attenuverter on parameters 2 & 3
respectively.

Parameter 4 applies a multiplier to the LFO time, according to the table in the Clockable Delay/Echo section, above.

Applied to audio, this algorithm is a wavetable-based waveshaper effect. More generally, considering the input as a CV
lookup, this algorithm provides a wavetable-based transfer function.

See 'Loading wavetables' above for a description of how to load wavetables onto the SD card.X is the input audio or CV.
The range Â±5V spans the full waveform.

Z applies a gain to X, with a range from 1x to approximately 16x.

The Y input controls the lookup point in the wavetable, with a range of Â±5V covering the whole table. Parameter 1
offsets the Y CV, effectively providing a means of manual wave selection.

Output A is the main output of the wavetable lookup. Output B is the same but using an inverted Y i.e. when A is using
the first wave in the table, B will be using the last and *vice versa*.

This algorithm is essentially a version of the Clockable Wavetable LFO, but with a trigger input instead of being
free-running. As such it can be thought of as a kind of envelope generator, where the envelope shape is defined by an
audio file in the wavetable.

See 'Loading wavetables' above for a description of how to load wavetables onto the SD card.

Input X is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. The time between rising trigger edges is used
to set the envelope time.

The Y input controls the lookup point in the wavetable, with a range of Â±5V covering the whole table. Parameter 1
offsets the Y CV, effectively providing a means of manual wave selection.

The Z input is the trigger for the envelope to start.

Outputs A & B are the result of the wavetable lookup. Each output has its own attenuverter on parameters 2 & 3
respectively.

Parameter 4 applies a multiplier to the envelope time, according to the table in the Clockable Delay/Echo section,
above.

Output A is a quantized version of the sum of inputs X & Y, according to the scale chosen with parameter 0.

The scales are defined by files on the MicroSD card â see âScala Supportâ, above. The keyboard mapping file is used to
define the subset of notes that the quantizer may use. For example, in the provided example files, the file '
root+fifth.kbm' can be used with a 12 note scale to make the quantizer only output the root or fifth in each octave.

Parameter 5 chooses between two fundamentally different modes of operation. When parameter 5 is 0 (the default), an
incoming CV is quantised to the closest pitch value defined by the chosen scale.

When the parameter is 1, the incoming CV is assumed linear 1V/octave and is used to look up a note in the scale
according to the keyboard map, based on the nearest semitone value of the input.

To understand the difference between these two modes, consider a scale with 19 degrees per octave, and an input CV
coming from a ramp LFO. In mode 0, the LFO will step through all 19 tones, arriving at an octave when the CV is 1V
higher than it started. In mode 1, when the LFO rises by 1V, the output will have only risen by 12 degrees of the scale;
it will need to rise by another half Volt or so to reach the octave. Or consider the same situation but with the input
from a keyboard, starting at 0V and rising 1/12th of a Volt per semitone. In mode 0, each semitone will be quantized to
the closest degree of the 19 tone scale, but you'll still only get 12 tones per octave. In mode 1, playing the keyboard
up from, say, C to C will give you 12 tones of the 19 tone scale; you would need to continue up to the next G to reach
the octave.

Output B is a trigger signal which fires whenever output A changes - a 5V pulse approximately 10ms long.

Parameters 1 & 2 are attenuators for inputs X & Y respectively. At 0 the input is completely attenuated; at 32 the input
is unattenuated.

If parameter 2 is set to -1, input Y becomes a trigger. In this mode, input X is only sampled and converted to a new
quantized value when input Y rises over approximately 1V. (In non-triggered mode, X is constantly sampled and a new note
is output as soon as X moves to the next scale degree.)

Parameter 3 is a transpose control. The transposition occurs after the quantization, and is in terms of the mapped notes
of the scale. For example, if you're using a seven tone scale, with all tones

mapped, then a transposition of 7 raises or lowers the pitch by an octave.

Parameter 4 sets an offset between the timing of the X & Y inputs (in sample frames). When using Y as a trigger, it is
often a good idea to delay it slightly relative to the pitch, to ensure that the pitch has changed and settled before
the trigger samples a new note.

The Z knob/CV controls the slew rate of output A. At the minimum value of Z, changes in A are instantaneous. As Z
increases, changes in A take place more slowly.

**MIDI Output**: each new note (i.e. when the Output B trigger fires) is output as a MIDI note message on the MIDI
channel selected in the settings. The note value is that of the position in the keyboard mapping of the current output.

This algorithm is a delay/echo effect, where the delay time is set from a clock pulse. It is basically the same as the
Clockable Delay/Echo algorithm, except that whereas that algorithm uses the module's RAM for storage, this one uses the
SD card, meaning that the delay time can be much, much longer â about 95 minutes. It also runs at the full sample rate,
so the audio fidelity is higher.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>SD card requirements</strong>

This algorithm is continually reading from and writing to the SD card. You will want a good quality, high-speed card. A microSDHC card like that recommended above will work well.
The algorithm creates a file on the card called 'DELAY.BIN'. This is created in a very specific way using low-level card access. Do not mess with the file, or attempt to copy it onto another SD card for another disting to use. The disting must create the file itself. You can however copy the file to your computer to process its contents, should you so wish.
It may be that the disting cannot create the file if the card is too fragmented, even if it says it has enough free space. In this case, the easiest solution is to reformat the card.

Input X is the signal input. Any audio signal can be fed in here.

Input Y is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. The time between rising trigger edges is used
to set the delay time. The minimum delay time that can be set is about 90ms.

The Z knob/CV controls the feedback, from zero to a maximum determined by parameter 1. At a parameter value of 0, the
maximum feedback is exactly 100%. At higher values, the maximum feedback goes over 100%, up to 125% at a parameter value
of 8.

Outputs A & B carry signals according to parameter 2:

'Mix' is a mix of the dry (undelayed) signal and the delay effect. The amount of delay in the mix rises in direct
proportion to the amount of feedback.

'Delay only' is the delayed signal only. Use this and the input signal, plus an external mixer, if you need more
flexibility in the dry/wet balance than is offered by the mixed mode.

Parameter 0 applies a multiplier to the delay time, according to the table in the Clockable Delay/Echo section, above.

This algorithm is affected by the 'SD delay max' setting â see above.

A and B are the stereo audio outputs. These are a mix of the inputs and the reverb output.Z is a wet/dry control. At
zero, the output is 100% dry i.e. the input signals with no reverb added. For positive Z, reverb is added while holding
the dry level constant. For negative Z, the dry and reverb signals are progressively crossfaded, until eventually the
output is 100% wet i.e. just the reverberation signal.

Pressing the Z knob 'freezes' the reverb â the reverb does not decay, and the input signal is not added into the reverb.
Press Z again to unfreeze it.

Parameters 0 & 1 together control the reverb time.

Parameter 2 changes the reverb 'character' - it chooses between a number of options for the reverb algorithm's internal
parameters leading to different sounding reverbs (some quite natural, others deliberately unnatural).

Parameter 3 applies a low pass filter to the reverb input. It does not affect the dry portion of the signal.

Parameter 4 is a gain control for the reverb output, in dB. It does not affect the dry signal.

Parameter 5 allows Z to become a CV input for the freeze feature. When the parameter is from -32 to 32, this value is
used to control the wet/dry balance, and the Z input becomes a freeze trigger.

The reverb freezes when Z goes above approximately 1V and unfreezes when Z falls below approximately 0.5V.

Parameter 6 applies a high pass filter to the reverb input. The range of cutoff frequencies is approximately 3Hz to
1.6kHz.

A dual vowel filter effect. A set of three bandpass filters (BPFs) is
used to mimic the response of the human vocal tract, resulting in
vowel-like sounds when provided suitable source material.
>
The algorithm can be used as a dual-mono effect, or as stereo (in
which case you'd want to select the same vowels for each channel).
>
Parameters 0 & 1 select the vowel sound for X/A and Y/B respectively.

For a good vowel effect, the input audio should be rich in harmonics.
A simple sawtooth works reasonably well. However, you can of course
put any audio you want through the filters.

Parameters 2 & 3 allow fine tuning of the gains of the second and
third BPFs, which can be used to tweak the vowel sounds if they're not
quite right for your usage.

A stereo chorus/flange effect.

X is the audio input.

A and B are the stereo audio outputs. These are a mix of the input and the chorus output.

Z is a wet/dry control. At zero, the outputs are 100% dry i.e. the input signal with no chorus added.

For positive Z, chorus is added while holding the dry level constant. For negative Z, the dry and chorus signals are
progressively crossfaded, until eventually the outputs are 100% wet i.e. just the chorus signals.

The chorus effect is generated via a number of LFOs. The LFO depth is set with parameter 0. The LFO speeds are set with
a combination of parameter 1 and input Y, which is a 1V/octave input centred on 4Hz for 0V.

Parameter 2 controls a feedback loop around the effect. Parameter 7 engages a saturation stage in the feedback loop,
which can prevent clipping, while adding some colouration to the sound.

Parameter 3 applies a low pass filter to the chorus input. It does not affect the dry portion of the signals.

Parameters 4 & 5 together set the delay time, with a range of approximately 200ms. Very small values give flanging;
medium values
(25-50ms) are more typical for chorus. Larger values give recognisable echoes.

Parameter 6 sets the number of stages i.e. the number of simultaneous delayed/modulated signals that combine to produce
the effect. Higher values will give a smoother, lusher chorus; small values are more appropriate to give a sharper, more
defined modulation, especially for flanging.

A stereo (noise) gate. The outputs are muted unless the input signal exceeds a threshold level.The Z knob/CV sets the
threshold, with a range of approximately 0-8V.

The outputs are muted by an envelope, triggered by the input signal rising above the threshold level. Parameters 0-2 set
the attack, hold and release times of the envelope. The hold time is the minimum amount of time the envelope is
considered to be triggered. The approximate time ranges for each parameter are: attack 10ms-1.8s, hold 0-600ms, release
45ms-8s.

Parameter 3 sets a lookahead time, effectively delaying the audio slightly relative to the trigger detection. This can
be used to ensure that sharp transients are not lost during the attack time of the envelope. The maximum lookahead is
about 10ms.

This algorithm combines LFOs and a ramp generator, a combination often used for vibrato which starts gradually from the
beginning of each note. The LFO is in fact not 'delayed' as such, but the naming is a nod to the equivalent feature on
such classic synths as the Juno-6.

Input X triggers the ramp, which starts from zero and ramps linearly up to a maximum over a time set from Y, which is an
exponential, 1V/octave, input. The LFO may be multiplied by the ramp, so it also starts from zero and ramps up to full
amplitude.

The trigger also resets the LFO phase to zero. This could be used even without the ramp to give you a resettable LFO.

The Z knob/input controls the LFO speed, which is also an exponential control.

Parameters 0 and 1 select the output waveforms on outputs A & B respectively. The choices are:

Parameters 2 & 3 set the range of the LFO and ramp times, both in quarter octaves (i.e. raising the value by 4 doubles
the speed).

Parameters 4 & 5 are attenuverters for outputs A & B, which apply whatever the selected output waveforms. Negative
values mean you can have a descending ramp, or LFOs with inverted phase. The unattenuated levels are 0-8V for the ramp
and Â±8V for the LFOs.

This algorithm generates LFOs, the amplitude and DC offset of which is controlled by the input CVs, according to
parameter 3 ('Mode').

If parameter 3 is zero, the X & Y inputs set the minimum and maximum values that the LFO will reach. For example, if X
is 3V and Y is 5V, the LFOs will sweep between 3-5V, or to look at it another way, the LFOs will be centred at 4V, with
a peak-to-peak amplitude of 2V.

If parameter 3 is one, the X input sets the centre of the LFO, while the Y input sets its amplitude. For example, if X
is 3V and Y is 1V, the LFOs' range will be 2V-4V. Note that in this mode if Y is zero, then A & B follow X. If X is a
pitch CV, then you effectively have a vibrato control on Y.

The Z knob/input controls the LFO speed, which is an exponential control.

Parameters 0 and 1 select the output waveforms on outputs A & B respectively. The choices are:

Parameter 2 sets the range of the LFO speed, in quarter octaves (i.e. raising the value by 4 doubles the speed).

Parameters 4 & 5 are offsets applied to inputs X & Y respectively. They are scaled in twelfths of a Volt, so if
interpreted as pitch CVs, in semitones.

This algorithm processes the inputs with half-wave rectification18, in
one of two different ways.

Equally useful for audio and CV manipulation, this allows you to split
a bipolar signal into its positive and negative sections, and to
combine two different waveforms, using the positive part of one and
the negative part of the other.
>
For ease of explanation, assume first that the Z knob/CV is at zero.
>
If the mode (parameter 0) is 0: output A is the positive part of X,
plus the negative part of Y. Output B is the negative part of X, plus
the positive part of Y.
>
If the mode is 1 or 2: the inputs are summed (mode 1) or subtracted
(mode 2). Then output A is the positive part of XÂ±Y, and output B is
the negative part of XÂ±Y.
>
If the mode is 3: output A is the positive part of input X; output B
is the positive part of input Y.

Z is a threshold control, allowing the various comparisons above to be
against a non-zero value. So for 'positive part' above read 'part
where the value is more than Z' etc.

This is a stereo delay/echo effect which simulates a variable speed tape loop echo device. The delay time at '1x speed',
with the tape length parameter at maximum, is just over 250ms.

X & Y are the audio inputs.

Parameters 0 & 1 together set the 'tape length', effectively setting the delay time. Parameter 0 is scaled in 10ms
increments, while parameter 1 is in 1ms increments (both assuming 1x 'tape speed').

If parameter 2 is 0 or more:

Z controls the speed of the 'tape', which also affects the delay time.
The speed range is from half speed to double speed. Parameter 4 is
added to the Z value as an offset.
>
Parameter 2 controls the feedback. A value of 32 gives 100% feedback.

If parameter 2 is -1:  
Z controls the feedback.

Parameter 4 controls the speed of the 'tape', which also affects the
delay time. The speed range is from half speed to double speed.

Outputs A & B carry signals according to parameter 3:

'Mix' is a mix of the dry (undelayed) signal and the delay effect. The amount of delay in the mix rises in direct
proportion to the amount of feedback.

'Delay only' is the delayed signal only. Use this and the input signals, plus an external mixer, if you need more
flexibility in the dry/wet balance than is offered by the mixed mode.

This is a pitch shifting audio effect, which can also be used as a delay. The pitch shifting is done using a granular
technique, that is, the output is composed of many short segments or 'grains' taken from the input.

Input X is the audio input.

Input Y is the pitch CV input, following the 1V/octave standard. Positive input voltages shift the pitch up; negative
voltages shift the pitch down.

Output A is a mix of the original audio and the pitch shifted version
(according to Z); output B is the pitch shifted version only.

Z is a wet/dry control. At zero, output A is 100% dry i.e. the input signal only. For positive Z, the pitch shifted
version is added while holding the dry level constant. For negative Z, the dry and pitch shifted signals are
progressively crossfaded, until eventually the output is 100% wet i.e. just the pitch shifted version.

Parameter 0 sets the grain length. Parameter 1 sets the shape of the grain 'window', or if you prefer, its envelope.
Best results will depend on the source material â experiment.

The effect uses an internal buffer to store the source material so it can be replayed as grains â therefore there is
some delay (or latency)
inherent in the algorithm. The delay can be controlled by parameter 2. If you are only ever pitching down, this can be
set very low. Pitching up requires a higher latency. If you are viewing this as a delay effect, then set the delay to
whatever you like. The maximum delay time is about 400ms.

Parameter 3 sets the delay feedback.

Parameters 4 & 5 provide a means of manually setting a pitch shift without feeding a signal into input Y. Parameter 4
shifts in semitones, while parameter 5 shifts in cents.

Pressing the Z knob 'freezes' the delay buffer â the input signal is no longer written into the buffer and the effect
will continuously output the frozen material. Press Z again to unfreeze it.

Parameter 6 allows you to set the mix and free up the Z CV input to control Freeze. When the parameter is at -65 (the
default) Z controls the mix. Other values of the parameter set the mix

Page 106

directly (from 100% wet to dry to an equal mix, just like when
controlling it via Z), and the Z input becomes a gate control for the
Freeze function, freezing the buffer when the CV goes over
approximately 1V.

precise gates obtainable are affected by these parameters.

The Z knob/CV sets the speed of the simulation i.e. the rate at which the outputs change.

Parameter 0 sets the range of speed values attainable, in quarter octaves (i.e. raising the value by 4 doubles the
speed).

Parameters 2 & 3 are attenuverters for outputs A & B.

Parameters 4 & 5 are offsets for outputs A & B (with a range of Â±8V).

Parameter 6 enables a clamp, in the event that the simulation becomes numerically unstable, in which case it is reset to
initial conditions. With the clamp disabled, the simulation can generate extreme values, which have nothing to do with
the Lorenz equations but are potentially useful in their own right.

Pushing Z resets the simulation to initial conditions.

This algorithm is a voltage controlled or triggered crossover switch. That is, either  
X â A and Y â B  
or  
X â B and Y â A  
Note that by using only one input, the algorithm effectively directs an input to one of two outputs (e.g. X to either A
or B); likewise, using only one output, the algorithm chooses between two inputs (e.g. A is either X or Y).

Being fully DC-coupled, the algorithm can be used for switching either audio or CV.

Parameter 0 chooses the mode â whether the Z knob/CV is a direct switch or a trigger.In mode 0, Z is a switch. The
switch occurs at 0V. Hysteresis can be applied to the switching voltage with parameter 1.

In mode 1, Z is a trigger. A positive-going input edge toggles the switch.

When using an external CV as a switch or trigger, you may like to turn the Z knob slightly counterclockwise.

A crossfade can be applied when switching to avoid clicks. The length of the fade (in milliseconds) is controlled by
parameter 2.

Page 108

Parameter 3 sets the probability that a switch transition will actually occur when triggered. Add one to the parameter
value to get the chance in %. The default value of 99 means a 100% chance of the switch transitioning; a value of -1
means a 0% chance i.e. the switch will never change.

This algorithm provides an emulation of a rotary speaker effect.

X is the audio input; A & B are the stereo audio outputs.

The dry/wet mix is controlled by the sum of the Y input and parameter 0.

The Z knob/CV controls the rotation speed. The 0-5V range corresponds to speeds from 0.8Hz to 6.7Hz. Below about -1V the
speed decreases and eventually stops altogether.

Parameter 1 sets the depth of the pitch modulation.

Parameter 2 sets the slew rate for speed changes. This plus a 5V gate signal into Z are your route to the classic
slow/fast rotary speed transitions.

Parameter 3 controls the frequency of a (first order) crossover filter. The part of the signal above the filter
frequency is fed into the rotary pitch modulation effect. The bass signal (below the crossover frequency)
is not pitch modulated, but is amplitude modulated at a slightly slower rate than the treble modulation. The depth of
the bass modulation is set by parameter 4.

If parameter 3 is zero, the crossover is disabled and the separate bass modulation is not applied.

If the crossover is used, but parameter 4 is zero, this essentially removes the effect entirely from the bass portion of
the input, keeping it centre stereo and at unmodulated pitch.

This algorithm is an implementation of pulsar synthesis, inspired by
the description in Curtis Roads's book Microsound (MIT Press)20
pp137-157.
>
In pulsar synthesis, a small grain of sound (known as a *pulsaret*,
typically a pulse or single cycle waveform) is repeated periodically,
followed by a small section of silence. The length of the sound within
the repeating period (equivalently, the speed at which it is played)
offers a means of control the timbre without affecting the perceived
pitch of the sound. By the same token, changing the fundamental pitch
without changing the speed at which the grain of sound is played
offers pitch change without simply shifting the entire spectrum up and
down, an effect reminiscent of 'vocal' or 'formant' synthesis.
>
This algorithm uses wavetables from the SD card as the source of the
pulsarets. See 'Loading wavetables' above for a description of how to
load wavetables onto the SD card.
>
Input X sets the fundamental frequency â the rate at which the
pulsaret train is generated.
>
Input Y sets the 'formant' frequency â the rate at which the pulsaret
is played. By default this is independent of the fundamental
frequency. If parameter 3 is set to 1, the X input is added to the Y
input, so changing the fundamental frequency also changes the formant
frequency.
>
Parameters 0 & 1 choose the wavetable and the wave within the table,
respectively.Parameter 2 chooses the window or envelope to apply to
the pulsaret. The options are:

The Z knob/CV depends on parameter 4. When parameter 4 is zero (the
default), Z is a tuning control, with a range of approximately Â±0.5
octaves. Otherwise, masking is applied â that is, pulsarets are
omitted from the train. In this case, outputs A & B use inverse masks
â output B will output a pulsaret when output A is suppressed, and
*vice versa*. If parameter 4 is 1, stochastic
>
20 Some of the text of this book is available on but I would urge you
to pick up a physical copy.

Page 110

masking is applied i.e. pulsarets are randomly masked. The likelihood of a pulsaret being masked is set by Z. If
parameter 4 is 2 or more, burst masking is applied â the parameter sets a number of pulsarets, and Z controls how many
pulsarets within that number will be masked.

Parameter 5 offsets the X input in octave steps.

**MIDI Input**: MIDI note messages received on the MIDI channel set in the Settings are converted to a CV which is added
to that on input X. The 0V note is 48 (C3).

This is a ping-pong version of the Clockable SD Delay algorithm as described above.

Being stereo, the maximum delay time is halved, to a mere 48 minutes.

Please be sure to read the 'SD card requirements' box.

Outputs A & B are the left and right outputs respectively. If the output mode parameter is 0 (the default), they are a
mix of the dry (undelayed)
signal and the delay effect. The amount of delay in the mix rises in direct proportion to the amount of feedback. If the
output mode parameter is 1, the outputs are the delayed signals only. Use this and the input signal, plus an external
mixer, if you need more flexibility in the dry/wet balance than is offered by output mode 0.

Parameter 2 controls the left/right pan position of the input signal.

**MIDI I/O**

***Introduction***

The disting mk4 has a pair of industry standard MIDI ports - one input, one output - which can be used to connect to a
huge variety of external equipment.

***Connections***  
The MIDI ports are exposed on a 4-pin expansion header (labelled GT2) at the top of the PCB:

<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image10.png" style="width:4.25555in;height:3.19167in" />

All of the necessary electronics are on the PCB; all that needs to be added is the actual sockets.The header pin-out is
as follows:

| **Pin** | **Function** |
|---------|--------------|
| 1       | OUT pin 4    |
| 2       | OUT pin 5    |
| 3       | IN pin 5     |
| 4       | IN pin 4     |

Pin numbers refer to the 5-pin DIN socket as in the .

The header is a standard 0.1" pitch header compatible with e.g. typical IDC cable sockets.

***Breakout module***

A passive breakout module which exposes the MIDI ports as 5-pin DIN sockets is available (also in kit form). See .

***MIDI "Low-Voltage Signaling"***  
When MIDI was first conceived, standard logic circuits ran at 5V, and the initial hardware reference

Page 112

designs worked on this assumption. However, there is nothing in the
MIDI standard that actually requires a specific voltage, since it
operates as a current loop via an opto-isolator.
>
Nowadays it is much more common for logic to run at 3.3V or lower. The
MIDI Manufacturers Association has now released a reference hardware
design based on 3.3V, which they call the "Low-Voltage Signaling"
standard, and it is this that the disting mk4 uses.
>
The disting is therefore fully compatible with any device that adheres
strictly to the MIDI specification, but may not be with devices that
play fast and loose with the spec and assume 5V.

***Controlling the disting mk4 via MIDI***
>
In addition to any algorithm-specific MIDI implementation, there are
common MIDI controls shared by all algorithms. These are as follows.
'&lt;in&gt;' for the MIDI channel indicates the MIDI input channel as
selected in the settings.

***MIDI Thru***
>
If enabled in the settings, the MIDI out port echoes any incoming MIDI
arriving at the in port. Note that no attempt is made to process or
merge this MIDI stream. If the disting is itself generating MIDI
output, using the Thru function at the same time is likely to result
in garbage MIDI output.

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The disting is calibrated before it leaves the factory. It is not expected that you would need to do this yourself in
normal circumstances.

***Calibration Procedure***

Calibration requires a 3V voltage reference. Any stable and accurate voltage source can be used. It's a good idea to let
the whole system warm up for 5 minutes before calibrating to stabilise any temperature-dependent factors.

The procedure is as follows:

1. With the disting powered up and with nothing connected to it, use the menu to select option

5, 'Calibrate'. The message 'GO' will be displayed.
>
2\. Wait a few seconds for the display to show '1' and for the
left-most column to flash.3. Using patch cables (as short as
possible), connect output A to input X, and output B to input
>
Y.
>
4\. Press the encoder.
>
5\. After a short delay, all four jack sockets should light up red.
After another short delay, the
>
display will show 'X' and the left-most column will flash.
>
6\. Remove the patch cables. Connect the 3V voltage reference to input
X.
>
7\. Verify the reference voltage, and press the encoder.
>
8\. Wait a few seconds for the display to show 'Y' and the left-most
column to flash.9. Connect the 3V voltage reference to input Y.
>
10\. Verify the reference voltage, and press the encoder.

11\. After a short pause, the disting will reboot, at which point the reference can be removed.If after step 10 the
disting displays the message "Uncalibrated", then the calibration was not performed correctly, and the data will not be
used. Start back at step 1.

***Calibration Data***

The disting's calibration data is stored in eight 32 bit words from address 0xBD01FE00 (disting mk1) or 0xBD03FE00 (
disting mk2/mk3). The first four refer to the left channel (input X/output A); the second four refer to the right
channel (input Y/output B).

Each value is a sample of the relevant input under certain conditions. These conditions are1. Input disconnected (and
therefore grounded)

2. Input connected to output, output outputting a nominal zero level
3. Input connected to output, output outputting a nominal half full range level4. Input connected to known 3V reference

From these we can derive constants A, Br, D, Er so that conversion between codec codes and actual voltages can be
handled simply in the code as follows:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>
int vL = ( ( inL - A[0] ) * Br[0] ) &gt;&gt; 24;
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>
int vR = ( ( inR - A[1] ) * Br[1] ) &gt;&gt; 24;
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>
int cL = ( ( vOutL - D[0] ) * Er[0] ) &gt;&gt; 24;
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>
int cR = ( ( vOutR - D[1] ) * Er[1] ) &gt;&gt; 24;
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

where inL/inR are the values read directly from the audio codec, cL/cR are the codes written directly to the audio
codec, and vL/vR/vOutL/vOutR are .19 format voltages.

The derivation of A, Br, D, Er is as follows:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>
Let the four input samples be zeroIn, zeroOut, halfOut, threeVolt.
A = zeroIn<br />
B = ( threeVolt - zeroIn )/3<br />
Br = 0x80000000000LL / B<br />
D = ( zeroOut - zeroIn )/B<br />
E = ( halfOut - zeroOut )/( B * 0x400000 ) Er = 0x80000000000LL / E
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The above is pseudo-code - a real C implementation is left as an exercise for the reader.
