Outputs A & B are LFOs (low frequency oscillators), with CV control of waveshape, and with the LFO cycle time set from a clock input. The output signals are ±8V (16V peak-to-peak) by default, but can be attenuated and inverted via parameters 0 & 1.

Input X is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. The time between rising trigger edges is used to set the cycle time.

Input Y controls the waveshape of the output signals. Signals in the range ±5V give the full range of possible waveshapes:

Output A: saw -> sine -> triangle

Output B: 0% duty cycle pulse -> 50% duty cycle pulse (square) -> 100% duty cycle pulse

Parameter 2 is an offset added to the Y CV, allowing manual selection of the waveshape.

The Z knob/CV sets a scale factor which is applied to the cycle time. The scale is an integer (whole number) which either multiplies or divides the frequency, and ranges in value from 1-16.

When Z changes, the scale is shown on the display. If the value shown is negative, it is a divisor rather than a multiplier. Note that there is no value of "-1" since dividing by 1 and multiplying by 1 are the same.
