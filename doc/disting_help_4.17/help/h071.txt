Similar to “I-7 Dual Audio Playback” except that the sample playback speed is controlled by the Z knob/CV input.

The two samples are selected by parameters 1 & 2.

Parameter 3 selects the panning option – refer to the description in the algorithm above.

Parameter 4 selects which samples are affected by the speed control, as follows:

0 Both samples' speeds controlled by Z.

1 Sample A speed fixed; B variable.

2 Sample B speed fixed; A variable.

3 Both samples' speeds are fixed.

Parameters 0 & 5 are the standard sample folder and envelope time parameters, described above.

The triggers are 'velocity sensitive' – the volume of the sample depends on the voltage of the trigger pulse.

MIDI Input: MIDI note on & off messages are handled equivalently to a trigger or gate on the X & Y inputs – that is, a note on retriggers the sample, and if the envelope time is non-zero, a note off will stop the playback. MIDI note 48 (C3) triggers sample A; note 49 triggers sample B.
