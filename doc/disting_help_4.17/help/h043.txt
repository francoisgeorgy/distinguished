This algorithm is a two-stage (attack/decay) envelope generator, whose overall time is set from an input clock pulse. The envelope is continuously output (starting on each new clock pulse). This algorithm also offers a VCA (voltage controlled amplifier) function.

Input X is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. The time between rising trigger edges is used to set the envelope time.

Parameter 0 applies a multiplier to the envelope time, according to the table above.

Input Y is the VCA input. The signal here will be multiplied by the envelope and output on output B.

Z sets the envelope shape, from short attack & long decay, to long attack and short decay.

Parameters 3 & 4 set the attack and decay shapes of the envelope respectively, from an exaggerated exponential curve at 0 to an almost linear shape at 32.

Output A is the envelope CV, and output B is the VCA output as mentioned above. Parameters 1 & 2 are attenuverters, which can attenuate and/or invert the signal for each output independently. The unattenuated envelope level is 8V; output B is unity gain with respect to input Y if unattenuated.

If parameter 1 is set to the special value 41, output A becomes an end-of-cycle trigger output, generating a 10ms 5V pulse at the end of the envelope's release stage.
