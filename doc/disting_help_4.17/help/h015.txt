This algorithm is a VCO with a 1V/octave pitch CV input (X), and waveshape/PWM input (Y). The 0V point for the pitch input is C3 (approximately 130.81Hz).

The Z knob/CV provides a tuning control, with a range of approximately ±0.5 octaves (but see also parameter 6, below).

Parameter 4 selects the output waveforms according to the following table:

0 A: Triangle/saw B: Square/pulse

1 A: Triangle/saw B: Sub-octave square

2 A: Square/pulse B: Sub-octave square

Input Y controls the waveshape of the output signals. Signals in the range ±5V give the full range of possible waveshapes:

Triangle/saw: saw (falling) -> triangle -> saw (rising)

Square/pulse: 0% duty cycle pulse -> 50% duty cycle pulse (square) -> 100% duty cycle pulse

The output signals are ±8V (16V peak-to-peak) by default, but can be attenuated via parameters 1 and 2.

Parameter 3 offsets the Y input, effectively providing a manual shape control if required. Parameter 5 transposes the VCO pitch, in semitone increments.

Parameter 6 controls the function of Z. At the default value of -51, Z is the tune control as already mentioned. When the parameter is set to a value from -50 to 50, Z no longer affects the tuning, and the parameter value is used as a fine tune control, in cents. Z then becomes a sync input: when Z goes over approximately 1V, the VCO phase is reset to zero, which can produce 'oscillator sync' sounds.

MIDI Input: MIDI note messages received on the MIDI channel set in the Settings are converted to a CV which is added to that on input X. The 0V note is 48 (C3).
