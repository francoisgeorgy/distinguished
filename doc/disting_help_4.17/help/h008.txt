If parameter 0 is 0 (the default): Output A is a sample of input X, taken when the trigger input Y goes over 1V. (Sample and Hold)

If parameter 0 is 1: Output A follows input X while input Y is over 1V. When Y falls below 0.5V, output A is held until Y goes over 1V again. (Track and Hold)

Output B is a white noise signal, with range Â±8V. A noise signal is commonly fed into the input of a sample and hold device to generate clocked random voltages.

Parameter 2 controls the noise colour:

0 Violet

1 White

2 Pink

3 Red

The Z knob/CV controls the slew rate of output A. At the minimum value of Z, changes in A are instantaneous. As Z increases, changes in A take place more slowly.

Pressing the Z knob triggers a sample manually.

Parameter 1 sets an offset between the timing of the X & Y inputs (in sample frames). If X & Y are being driven together, for example by a sequencer's pitch and gate, it is often a good idea to delay the trigger slightly to allow time for the sampled CV to settle before the sample is taken.

Parameter 3 adds the noise output into the input signal, equivalent to patching output B into input X via an attenuator.
