Performs a MIDI to CV conversion on MIDI notes arriving on the disting's MIDI port.

Output A is the pitch CV output; output B is the gate output.

Outputs A & B can also be controlled directly via MIDI CCs 33 & 34 respectively (the CC range of 0-127 is mapped to -5V to +5V), or via MIDI CCs 35 & 36 (the CC range of 0-127 is mapped to 0V to 10V).

The received MIDI channel is selected in the settings.

Parameter 2 selects a scale to use, if any are provided on the SD card. See “Scala Support” above. The default value of -1 disables this function.

Parameter 3 enables a 'fingered portamento' effect, that is, a glide from one note to the next if they are played legato. Higher parameter values give a slower glide.
