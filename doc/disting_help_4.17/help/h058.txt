Output A is a quantized version of input X; the closest whole-semitone value to the unquantized V/octave pitch CV X. Similarly output B is a quantized version of input Y.

As well as providing a chromatic scale, this algorithm can also constrain the quantized values to a musical scale or chord. This is controlled by the Z knob/CV.

When Z changes, the scale is displayed on the LEDs. The scale's number in the following table is shown, and after a short pause, the scale's name.

0 chromatic

1 major scale

2 minor scale

3 major triad

4 minor triad

5 root+5th

6 major triad+6th

7 minor triad+6th

8 major triad+7th

9 minor triad+7th

10 root+5th+6th

11 root+5th+7th

12 pentatonic major

13 pentatonic minor

14 natural minor scale

15 harmonic minor scale

For each quantizer, a parameter provides a transpose control. The transposition is applied to the input before it is forced into the chosen scale i.e. the transposition moves the notes around within the same key.

MIDI Output: each new note is output as a MIDI note message on the MIDI channel selected in the settings (input X/output A) or on the next highest channel (input Y/output B). E.g. if the settings specify MIDI channel 4, the notes are output on channels 4 (X/A) and 5 (Y/B).
