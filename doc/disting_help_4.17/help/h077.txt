This algorithm plays audio files, using a 1V/octave pitch input (Y) to both select the sample and control its pitch. This would typically be used for playing a multisampled instrument across a range of pitches, or for mapping individual sounds (e.g. drums) to different notes.

X is a retrigger input. A trigger pulse in excess of 1V will reset the playback position to the start of the sample.

The Z knob/CV provides a tuning control, with a range of approximately ±0.5 octaves. Note that this is applied after the sample has been selected using the Y CV; changing Z will not affect the sample selection.

A & B are the left & right audio outputs respectively.

Parameter 1 shifts the pitch up or down in octave increments. It is equivalent to offsetting the pitch CV input – it also affects the sample selection.

Parameters 0 & 2 are the standard sample folder and envelope time parameters, described above.

MIDI Input: MIDI note on & off messages are handled equivalently to a trigger or gate on the X input – that is, a note on retriggers the sample, and if the envelope time is non-zero, a note off will stop the playback. Additionally, the pitch of the note on message is used instead of the Y input CV, so you can effectively play the disting like a sampler from a MIDI keyboard. MIDI note 48 (C3) corresponds to a 0V input. MIDI pitch bend is supported; parameter 4 sets the bend depth in semitones.

Parameter 3 'MIDI mode' works in the same way as for algorithm I-3 – see above.
