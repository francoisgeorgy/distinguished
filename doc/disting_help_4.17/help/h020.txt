This algorithm implements a resonator, which is a kind of filter, but which is also often found as the basis for analogue drum synthesis.

X is the input for the signal to filter. If used as a drum synth, this is the trigger input. The amplitude and nature of the trigger signal will affect the resulting sound.

Y sets the pitch of the resonator, with a 1V/octave response. The 0V point for the pitch input is C3 (approximately 130.81Hz). Parameter 0 provides a pitch offset in semitones.

Z sets the gain. In terms of drum synthesis, more gain means a longer decay time.

A is the audio output.

B outputs the result of envelope tracking the audio output A.

Pressing Z simulates hitting X with a 1ms 5V pulse, and so works as a manual trigger of the 'drum'.
