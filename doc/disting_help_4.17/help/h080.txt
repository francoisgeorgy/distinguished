This algorithm is a wavetable VCO. See for example here for a brief overview of wavetable synthesis.

X is the pitch input for the VCO, with a 1V/octave response. The 0V point for the pitch input is C3 (approximately 130.81Hz).

The Z knob/CV provides a tuning control, with a range of approximately ±0.5 octaves.

The Y input controls the lookup point in the wavetable, with a range of ±5V covering the whole table. Parameter 2 offsets the Y CV, effectively providing a means of manual wave selection.

Output A is the main output of the wavetable VCO.

Output B generates a signal according to parameters 3 and 4. If parameter 4 is -1 (the default), the output is as follows:

-3 A ±8V square wave one octave below output A

-2 Wavetable VCO one octave below output A

-1 Wavetable VCO one octave above output A

0-99 Wavetable VCO detuned relative to output A; output A is also detuned in the opposite direction.

If parameter 4 is 0-99, output B is a copy of output A with a fixed phase offset from 0-99% as defined by the parameter. (So for example if you want quadrature outputs, set the phase to 25.)

MIDI Input: MIDI note messages received on the MIDI channel set in the Settings are converted to a CV which is added to that on input X. The 0V note is 48 (C3).
