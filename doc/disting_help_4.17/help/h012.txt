Outputs A & B are LFOs (low frequency oscillators), with CV control of frequency and waveshape. The output signals are ±8V (16V peak-to-peak) by default, but can be attentuated via the parameters. The scale factor is (1+parameter value)/32, so at the minimum parameter value of -1 there is no output at all.

The outputs can also have a DC offset applied. The offset in Volts is (parameter value)/4 i.e. the range is ±7.75, in steps of 0.25V.

Input X is a Hz/V frequency control, scaled at 1Hz/V. Note that the input is allowed to go negative, resulting in a phase-reversed output.

Knob/CV Z is a tuning control, with a range of approximately ±10Hz. This is simply added to the setting from input X (so with input X disconnected, the knob can be used to manually set an LFO rate).

Input Y controls the waveshape of the output signals. Signals in the range ±5V give the full range of possible waveshapes:

Output A: saw -> sine -> triangle

Output B: 0% duty cycle pulse -> 50% duty cycle pulse (square) -> 100% duty cycle pulse
