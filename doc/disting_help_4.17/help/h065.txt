This algorithm plays audio files, the speed of which is set by incoming clock pulses.

The current audio file is selected with the Z knob/CV, if parameter 2 is -1, or by the parameter itself, if it is in the range 0-99.

X is a retrigger input. A trigger pulse in excess of 1V will reset the playback position to the start of the sample, if Z is being used to select the sample, or to the position set by Z (the full range of Z, approximately -5V to 5V, corresponds to the length of the sample).

Y is the clock input. The speed of the sample playback is adjusted so that the whole sample fits into the time taken for a number of clocks, where that number is set (per sample) in the playlist.

When switching between files, the playback position is maintained, as for the I-1Audio Playback algorithm.

A & B are the left & right audio outputs respectively.

Parameters 0 & 1 are the standard sample folder and envelope time parameters, described above.

MIDI Input: MIDI note on & off messages are handled equivalently to a trigger or gate on the X input â€“ that is, a note on retriggers the sample, and if the envelope time is non-zero, a note off will stop the playback.
