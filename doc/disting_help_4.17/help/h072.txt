Algorithm-specific playlist filename: midi-playlist-clocked.txt

This algorithm plays MIDI files, converting the MIDI into CV outputs on A & B (as detailed above).

The current MIDI file is selected with the Z knob/CV, if parameter 0 is -1, or by the parameter itself if it is in the range 0-31, in which case Z is not used.

The X input is a clock, which controls the speed of the MIDI file playback. A clock pulse should exceed 1V. The clocks correspond to quarter notes in the MIDI file.

Y is a retrigger input. A trigger pulse in excess of 1V will reset the file to the beginning.

MIDI Output: the MIDI file being played is transmitted unaltered on the disting's MIDI output.
