This algorithm implements a mono compressor with side-chain input.

X is the audio input; A is the audio output.

Y is the side-chain input, which drives the compression amount applied to the audio signal on X. The B output provides a CV reflecting the amount of gain reduction being applied.

The Z knob/CV sets the compression ratio, from 1 (no compression) at fully counterclockwise, to infinity (effectively limiting rather than compression) at fully clockwise. Parameter 0 sets the threshold level above which compression applies (in dB).

Parameters 1 & 2 set the attack and release times. The attack time range is approximately 0.1ms-1s; the release time range is approximately 1ms-3s.

Parameter 3 sets the make-up gain (in dB). If set to -1, the make-up gain is calculated automatically from the threshold and compression ratio.

Parameter 4 sets a lookahead time, effectively delaying the audio slightly relative to the envelope detection. This can be used to ensure that sharp transients are not lost during the attack time of the envelope. The maximum lookahead is about 10ms.
