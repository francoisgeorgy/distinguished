This algorithm implements a phase shifter or 'phaser' effect.

X is the audio input.

Y is the sweep input. 0V to 8V covers the whole range; negative voltages are treated as 0V. You will almost always want to patch an LFO in here. Parameter 0 can be used to set this to a 'centre' value, which makes it easier to patch in an LFO to the Y input without having to add a DC offset to the LFO.

Z controls feedback. More feedback results in more extreme phasing effects. When Z is negative, the feedback is inverted, which gives a different-sounding phasing effect.

A outputs the combination of the phase-shifted signal and the original signal, which is usually what you need for a classic phaser effect, since it's the interaction of the original signal and the phase- shifted version which produces the 'comb filtering' effect.

Output B provides just the phase shifted signal, if you need more contorl over how this and the original signal are mixed.

Parameter 1 sets the number of phase shifting stages. The more stages, the more notches there are in the comb filter, which results in a more pronounced effect.
