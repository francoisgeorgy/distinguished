This algorithm provides a software implementation of the Expert Sleepers ES-2 module. The in conjunction with the Silent Way CV Input plug-in this allows you to pass CVs from your modular into your DAW via a regular audio interface.

X & Y are the two inputs - connect these to CV outputs from your modular.

A & B are the corresponding outputs - connect these to inputs on your audio interface.

Z provides a trim control, allowing adjustment of the ES-2's operating frequency. Start with this at zero (LEDs off) and adjust to minimise noise in the CV recovered from the plug-in.
