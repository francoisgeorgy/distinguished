This algorithm records the incoming audio to a WAV file on the MicroSD card.

X & Y are the audio inputs. The incoming audio is echoed directly to the A & B outputs.

The Z knob/CV controls recording. When Z exceeds approximately 1V, recording starts. When it falls below 0.5V, recording stops.

Do not remove the MicroSD card or power off the disting while recording is active, as this could corrupt the card.

The recorded WAV files are stereo, 16 bit, 46.875kHz. The files are named sequentially starting with REC00000.WAV (then REC00001.WAV, REC00002.WAV etc.). If there are already recordings on the card, the next available filename will be used; the old files will not be overwritten.

The files are placed in a folder named '!RECORD'11. If this folder does not exist, it will be created.

When recording is complete, a small text file will also be written to the card, with the same filename but with the extension '.TXT'. This will detail any dropouts that occurred while recording the file (or ideally simply 'No dropouts').

The disting's screen shows different information than the usual algorithm name or parameter values in this mode. The left two columns of LEDs display level meters for the two audio inputs. The right section of the screen either shows a rectangle (for recording stopped) or a recording animation (when recording).
