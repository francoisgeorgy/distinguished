Applied to audio, this algorithm is a wavetable-based waveshaper effect. More generally, considering the input as a CV lookup, this algorithm provides a wavetable-based transfer function.

See 'Loading wavetables' above for a description of how to load wavetables onto the SD card.

X is the input audio or CV. The range ±5V spans the full waveform.

Z applies a gain to X, with a range from 1x to approximately 16x.

The Y input controls the lookup point in the wavetable, with a range of ±5V covering the whole table. Parameter 1 offsets the Y CV, effectively providing a means of manual wave selection.

Output A is the main output of the wavetable lookup. Output B is the same but using an inverted Y i.e. when A is using the first wave in the table, B will be using the last and vice versa.
