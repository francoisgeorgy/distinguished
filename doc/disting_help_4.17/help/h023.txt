This algorithm is a 'bit crusher' - it applies sample rate and sample depth reduction to deliberately introduce quantisation and aliasing artefacts. It also optionally applies bitwise modification of the samples for non-linear distortion effects.

X is the signal input.

Y is the sample rate reduction CV input. It has a 1V/octave response i.e. the sample rate is reduced by a factor of 2 for every 1V rise in CV. This CV is offset by parameter 0, so you can set a rate reduction without a CV input.

A is the signal output.

B is the output of a comparator. Output A is compared against zero; output B is +5V if A is above zero, or 0V if A is below zero.

The Z control sets the bit depth reduction. There are two types of bit reduction available:

• Type I - the signal is quantised to a 16 bit word, and the low bits thrown away. The resulting signal uses a power of 2 bits. Changing between bit depths is therefore discontinous.

• Type II - quantisation is achieved via the limited precision of integer maths when dividing the signal by a factor. Since the factor can be continuously varied, this offers a smooth variation between 'bit depths'.

Furthermore, positive and negative values of Z have different effects.

• Positive Z treats the whole signal range as one number to be quantised.

• Negative Z treats positive and negative sections of the input signal differently. Negative sections are flipped positive, quantized, and flipped back.

Parameter 1 selects the type of bit reduction. The positive and negative sections of the input signal can have different types of reduction applied.
