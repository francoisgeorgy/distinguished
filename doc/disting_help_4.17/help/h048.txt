This algorithm provides a software implementation of the Expert Sleepers ES-1 module. The in conjunction with the Silent Way AC Encoder plug-in this allows you to pass CVs from your DAW to your modular via an AC coupled audio interface.

X & Y are the two inputs - connect these to outputs from your audio interface.

A & B are the corresponding outputs - connect these to CV inputs in your modular.

Z provides a trim control. Adjust this so that a zero CV entering the AC Encoder plug-in gives you a zero CV out of the disting (either with a voltmeter, or by eye, just looking at the colour of the disting's output jacks).
