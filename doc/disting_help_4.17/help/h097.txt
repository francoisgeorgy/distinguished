This algorithm generates LFOs, the amplitude and DC offset of which is controlled by the input CVs, according to parameter 3 ('Mode').

If parameter 3 is zero, the X & Y inputs set the minimum and maximum values that the LFO will reach. For example, if X is 3V and Y is 5V, the LFOs will sweep between 3-5V, or to look at it another way, the LFOs will be centred at 4V, with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 2V.

If parameter 3 is one, the X input sets the centre of the LFO, while the Y input sets its amplitude. For example, if X is 3V and Y is 1V, the LFOs' range will be 2V-4V. Note that in this mode if Y is zero, then A & B follow X. If X is a pitch CV, then you effectively have a vibrato control on Y.

The Z knob/input controls the LFO speed, which is an exponential control.

Parameters 0 and 1 select the output waveforms on outputs A & B respectively. The choices are:

0 triangle

1 sine

2 square

3 rising ramp

4 falling ramp

Parameter 2 sets the range of the LFO speed, in quarter octaves (i.e. raising the value by 4 doubles the speed).

Parameters 4 & 5 are offsets applied to inputs X & Y respectively. They are scaled in twelfths of a Volt, so if interpreted as pitch CVs, in semitones.
