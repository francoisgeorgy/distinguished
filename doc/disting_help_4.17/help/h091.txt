A dual vowel filter effect. A set of three bandpass filters (BPFs) is used to mimic the response of the human vocal tract, resulting in vowel-like sounds when provided suitable source material.

The algorithm can be used as a dual-mono effect, or as stereo (in which case you'd want to select the same vowels for each channel).

Parameters 0 & 1 select the vowel sound for X/A and Y/B respectively. The available sounds are as follows:

-1

Chosen from the range below by the Z knob/CV.

0 /ow/ bought

1 /oo/ boot

2 /a/ hot

3 /uh/ but

4 /er/ bird

5 /ae/ bat

6 /e/ bet

7 /i/ bit

8 /iy/ beet

For a good vowel effect, the input audio should be rich in harmonics. A simple sawtooth works reasonably well. However, you can of course put any audio you want through the filters.

Parameters 2 & 3 allow fine tuning of the gains of the second and third BPFs, which can be used to tweak the vowel sounds if they're not quite right for your usage.
