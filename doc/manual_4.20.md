## Introduction.........................................................

Congratulations on your purchase of an Expert Sleepers disting mk4. Please read this user manual
before operating your new module.

## Installation...........................................................

House the module in a Eurorack case of your choosing. The power connector is Doepfer standard. If
using the power cable supplied with the module, the red edge of the cable is nearest the bottom of
the PCB, and carries -12V. ("-12V" is marked on the PCB itself next to this end of the connector.)
Be sure to connect the other end of the power cable correctly, again so -12V corresponds to the red
stripe on the cable.

### Power requirements........................................

The disting mk4 draws 51mA on the +12V rail, and 19mA on the -12V rail.

It does not use the 5V rail.

## Inputs, Outputs and Controls...............................

```
From top to bottom, the disting has
```
- A rotary encoder/push button, named 'S'.
- A dot matrix display.
- A MicroSD card slot.
- A knob, referred to as the 'Z' control, which controls some
  aspect of the algorithm. This knob also has a push button
  function.
- Three input sockets.
  â¦ The top input is the 'Z' CV input, which controls the
  same thing as the 'Z' knob. The two are added
  together.
  â¦ The other two inputs are 'X' and 'Y', and their function
  depends on the current algorithm.
- Two output sockets, named 'A' and 'B'.

The sockets are illuminated to reflect the voltage at the socket (or in the case of 'Z', the combined
voltage of the input and the knob). Red indicates a positive voltage; blue indicates a negative
voltage.

## Inserting a MicroSD card....................................

The disting's MicroSD card slot is to the left of the display.

The exposed contacts of the card should face towards the display; the angled side of the card itself
points up.

The slot is of the "push-push" type - to remove the card, push it in slightly and it will spring out.


## Startup.................................................................

```
Video
```
When the module powers up it first runs through some patterns on its display. The sequence is as
follows:

- Each of the seven columns in turn, from left to right.
- Each of the five rows in turn, from bottom to top.

It then shows the bootloader version (e.g. "b1") and the current firmware version (e.g. "v4.0").

If after the above the disting shows the message "Uncalibrated", then the calibration data in flash is
missing or corrupt. A default calibration will be used, but for accurate results, please recalibrate the
module (see below).

## The encoder & menu system...............................

```
Video
```
Pressing the encoder ('S') enters the disting's menu system, which is indicated by the display
blinking.

At this time the menus are particularly simple, there being only six menu items to choose from, only
one of which you will normally need. In general, the menu system works like this:

- Press the encoder to enter menu mode.
- Turn the encoder to select the menu item, and press to select.
- At this point the behaviour depends on the chosen menu item.

Pressing 'Z' at any time cancels and exits the menus.

The menu items are:

- Algorithm â select algorithm
- Save â save a preset
- Load â load a preset
- Help â access help
- Settings â change settings
- Calibrate â begin calibration
  â¦ If you accidentally enter this mode, press the Z knob to cancel

## Selecting an algorithm.........................................

```
Video
```
There is a single list of algorithms, named A1 up to P8 (i.e. A1, A2, ... up to A8, then B1, B2 etc.).
See below for details.

The algorithm can be chosen via menu 1 "Algorithm". Press the encoder twice (to enter the menu,
and to select "Algorithm"). Then turn the encoder to select the algorithm. Finally, press the encoder
again to switch to the chosen algorithm.


## Settings................................................................

```
Video
```
The disting has a number of settings, which are stored in flash memory. They are accessed by menu
4 "Settings". Once you've entered the Settings menu, turn the encoder to select the setting to
change.

The settings are:

- **Brightness** â set the display brightness.
- **Recall enable** â enable/disable recall from the Select Bus (see below).
- **In MIDI ch** â the input MIDI channel.
- **Out MIDI ch** â the output MIDI channel.
- **Thru MIDI** â enables a soft MIDI thru.
- **Pgm Chng Alg** â controls whether MIDI program change messages select the current
  algorithm (1) or load a preset (0).
- **Cont filenames** â if set, WAV and MIDI filenames scroll continuously in the display; if
  unset, filenames scroll once when a new file is chosen, and then the display reverts to the
  default algorithm name view.
- **Scroll speed** â the speed at which text scrolls across the display.
- **WAV sample rate** â sample rate to use for the Audio Playback algorithms. The default (0)
  uses the disting's usual sample rate of 75kHz. The alternative (1) uses a reduced rate of
  46875Hz. This can help reduce the load on the SD card, useful if e.g. you have a slower
  card.
- **SD delay max** â the maximum delay time, in minutes, for the various Clockable SD Delay
  algorithms. If the time between two taps is longer than this, the second will be ignored. This
  also affects how much of the delay file is wiped when the algorithm is chosen, which
  therefore affects how long the algorithm takes to start.
- **Switch param** â if set, when a MIDI CC message is received to change a parameter value,
  that parameter becomes the current parameter (and so its value is displayed).

Once you've chosen the setting to change, press the encoder to select it, at which point the setting's
current value will be shown. Turn the encoder to change the value. Then press the encoder to accept
and store the value into flash, or press Z to leave the menu without storing the value.

## Help.....................................................................

```
Video
```
Accessing 'Help' from the menu displays algorithm-specific information. The help is loaded from
the MicroSD card, if present (else the message "No card" is displayed), and scrolled across the
display. To exit the help function, press Z.

The help text is a simple plain text file on the card, so it can be freely edited (e.g. to put your own
choice of information first, or to translate it into a different language).


The default set of help files can be downloaded from the firmware update page here. Simply unzip
the file onto your MicroSD card. The file structure should look something like this:

i.e. the 'help' folder is at the root level of the card, and inside is a file per algorithm, named
'hXXX.txt', where XXX is the algorithm number, starting from zero for algorithm A1.

## Parameters...........................................................

```
Video
```
In addition to the control provided on the Z knob, each algorithm may have up to eight 'parameters',
offering further control over the algorithm's operation.

Unlike the Z control, which is sampled at the same high rate as the X & Y inputs, parameters should
be considered coarse, non-real-time adjustments to the algorithm. They may cause glitching in the
outputs when changed.

Parameters are adjusted via the S knob. When changed, the parameter value is displayed for a
couple of seconds.

If an algorithm has more than one parameter, pressing the Z knob cycles through them (unless the
algorithm uses Z for Tap Tempo or some other purpose). The current parameter number is
displayed briefly followed by its name.

The current parameter can also be selected by pushing in the S knob and turning it while holding it
in. The parameter number is shown when you turn the knob; if you pause briefly without turning the
knob, the parameter name is shown.

## Knob Recorder....................................................

```
Video
```
In many algorithms which do not use a Z knob press for another purpose, pressing Z offers a 'knob


recorder' function.

When this is available, holding Z down while turning it causes the Z value changes to be recorded.
As soon as the knob is released, the recording is played back in a loop. To end playback, turn the Z
knob slightly to regain manual control.

The maximum duration of knob recording is a little under 14 seconds.

## Tap Tempo..........................................................

```
Video
```
Some algorithms (notably the Clockable LFO and Clockable Delay/Echo) use a press of the Z knob
as a 'tap tempo' function. In these modes, pressing Z has the same effect as sending a clock pulse
into the clock input. For example, pressing Z twice will set the delay time/LFO period to the time
between the two button presses.

Note that if the algorithm is dividing down the clocked frequency, pressing Z twice will not set the
output to the division of the time between the two presses; rather, it will be the time between a
corresponding number of button presses. E.g. if the Clockable LFO is set to 1/4 (divide by 4), the
LFO time will be set by pressing the Z button 5 times, and it will only change on the 5th press.

## Favourites............................................................

You can define your own list of 16 'favourite' algorithms, via a text file on the MicroSD card.

The favourites are accessed as algorithms O1-P8. If no favourites are defined, or if there are empty
slots, the disting runs algorithm A1, the Precision Adder.

The favourites are read from the SD card, if present, at power on. They are then stored in the
disting's flash memory, and so persist even after the card is removed.

The favourites file is a simple text file which must be named 'favourites.txt' and placed in the root of
the SD card (not inside any folder). The contents look something like this:

```
disting favourites v
B8 VCO
a
C5 resonator
I4 SD z speed
b5 LFO
e6 dual AR w/ push
```
The first line must be "disting favourites v2". Subsequent lines specify an algorithm to add to the
list of favourites. After 16 algorithms, any further lines are ignored.

Each algorithm is specified as its two character name (a letter followed by a number). Any further
text after the algorithm number is ignored, so you can add a descriptive string (as in the example
above) to help you remember what's what.


## Presets................................................................

```
Video
```
The disting can store its current state to flash memory as a preset. The contents of a preset are

- the chosen algorithm.
- the parameter values.
- the current parameter number.

Anything controlled by the Z knob/CV is not stored â its value is always defined by the knob
position and CV input.

There are 64 preset slots. Presets are saved and recalled using the menu. To save a preset:

1. Press the encoder to enter menu mode.
2. Turn the encoder once (to show 'Save'), and press to confirm.
3. Turn the encoder to choose the preset slot.
4. Press the encoder to complete the save.

As usual, pressing Z at any point exits the menu without saving.

To load a preset:

1. Press the encoder to enter menu mode.
2. Turn the encoder twice (to show 'Load'), and press to confirm.
3. Turn the encoder to choose the preset slot.
4. Press the encoder to complete the load.

If the current algorithm was selected via the Favourites, the actual algorithm chosen is saved in the
preset, not the favourites slot.^1

### Preset 0.........................................................

Preset 0, the first slot, is special:

- The contents of preset 0 are loaded at power-up.
- When switching algorithm, the new algorithm state is saved to preset 0.^2

Therefore if you want to save the disting's state so it powers up as it is currently, you can manually
save to preset 0, which is âclick, turn, click, clickâ on the encoder.

Preset 0 is also an exception to the above comment regarding favourites. The actual favourites slot
is stored.

1 So if you change the favourites, the presets are unaffected.
2 The thinking here is that if you forget to save your preset before turning off the power, at least the disting will come
back up in the same algorithm next time you start.


## Select Bus..........................................................

```
Video
```
If enabled in the settings, the disting mk4 will respond to save/recall messages on the Select Bus.

The Select Bus is a means of inter-module communication currently supported by a handful of
modules from various manufacturers, including the Malekko Varigate 8+, Macro Machines Storage
Strip and the Make Noise Tempi & RenÃ© 2.

Note that the disting only responds to save/recall messages. It does not initiate them.

Any MIDI that arrives on the Select Bus that is not explicitly part of the Select Bus protocol will be
used as if it arrived on the disting's regular MIDI input â see below.


## SD Card Playback.............................................

### Supported MicroSD cards............................

In theory any MicroSD card will work, but in practice there is a huge variety of cards on the market
and we cannot possibly test them all. We recommend 32GB SDHC cards, and in particular have
found "SanDisk Extreme 32GB microSDHC UHS-I U3" cards work well.

The MicroSD card must be formatted in FAT32 format, which is the as-sold state for many cards. If
not, cards can easily be reformatted to FAT32 in Windows or macOS.

The card also needs to be partitioned using the 'Master Boot Record' (MBR) scheme. In macOS's
Disk Utility, you may need to select View->Show All Devices to inspect the partitioning scheme.
The Erase settings should look like this:

### Supported audio files....................................

As of now, the only supported audio file format is 16 bit WAV, mono or stereo. Any sample rate
can be used, however.

Since higher sample rates impose greater bandwidth demands on the SD card streaming, we suggest
you use the lowest sample rate that gives acceptable audio quality. All our testing generally uses
44.1kHz files.

Note that because the disting's outputs are DC-coupled, the 'audio' files can actually contain
recorded or generated CVs, so all the sample playback modes can also be used as complex
modulation or sequencing sources.

### Audio file naming & Playlists......................

Audio files must have the extension '.wav' (or any other capitalisation of that e.g. '.WAV').


The files should be placed in folders on the SD card. Unless noted otherwise, audio playback
algorithms all support up to 100 folders of 100 sample files each. The folders themselves should be
at the top level of the card i.e. not inside any higher level folder.

The disting also supports 'playlist' files, which are simple text files that instruct the disting which
files/folders to look at and which ones to ignore, and also allow setting of options on a per-sample
file basis. Unless noted otherwise these files are optional.

The playlist filename is 'playlist.txt'. If a playlist is found in the root of the card, it will be taken as a
list of folders in which to look for WAV files. If a playlist is found inside a folder of WAV files, it
will be used to determine which files to use, the order in which to use them, and to set the per-file
options.

Note that it is explicitly allowed to have a playlist file which only contains global settings, but lists
no actual WAV files. In this case, the settings in the playlist will be used, and the folder scanned for
WAV files automatically.

If playlists are not used, folder and file names are sorted alphabetically.

### Loop markers in audio files..........................

The disting supports reading loop information embedded in the WAV file. If this information is not
present, or is disabled with the playlist option (see below), any mode that loops the sample simply
loops the whole file.

Loops are inferred either from markers (cue points in WAV format parlance) or regions, as follows:

```
1 marker point in file Marker is assumed to be loop start; loop is from the marker to the
end of the sample.
2 marker points in file Markers are used as loop start and end.
3 or more marker points in file First marker is ignored (assumed to be playback start point);
second and third markers used as loop points. Remaining markers
ignored.
1 or more regions in file First region is used as the loop; other regions and markers
ignored.
```
This video illustrates the use of loop markers:

```
Video
```
### Supported MIDI files....................................

Currently we support Format 0 files (single track). The division field of the header chunk must be in
"ticks per quarter note" format.

Happily this is the format that Ableton Live spits out if you do "Export MIDI Clip".

### MIDI file naming & Playlists.......................

All MIDI files need to be in a folder named 'MIDI'^3. They can use any naming convention but the
extension '.mid' is usual.

A playlist file (see below) specifies what MIDI files the algorithm will use, how they will be
ordered, and what playback settings they will use. It is a simple text file, as described below, and is

3 Note that this changed in firmware 4.19 â previously the MIDI files went in the card root.


optional. If no playlist is provided, the MIDI playback algorithms search for any '.mid' files in the
'MIDI' folder. Of course, if you do not provide a playlist, you cannot customise the settings for the
MIDI files.

By default, MIDI algorithms look for a file named 'midi-playlist.txt'. However, each MIDI playback
algorithm first looks for an algorithm-specific playlist file, the name of which is specified in the
algorithm descriptions below.

The playlist files must be plain text. Note that TextEdit on macOS defaults to rich text. From the
'Format' menu choose, 'Make Plain Text'.

### Audio Playlist Format...................................

An audio playlist file might look something like this:

```
disting playlist v
-loop=
-gap=
-fadeIn=
-fadeOut=
TR66_BD_aOrig_b_R1.wav
-fixedPitch=0.
TR66_Snare_aOrig_b_R1.wav
sample01.wav
-loop=
-ramp=
funky_lp.wav
-loop=
-triggers=
586447main_JFKwechoosemoonspeech.wav
-loop=
```
This breaks down as:

- The header: "disting playlist v1"
- Default settings (optional)
- List of audio files
- Per-file settings after each file (optional)

Files may appear more than once in the playlist, with the same or different settings.

Settings are in the format "-" <setting name> "=" <setting value>

Settings that appear before any audio file apply globally to all the files in the playlist, unless
overridden by the per-file settings.

The available settings are as follows.

```
Setting Default Description
loop 1 Whether the sample loops (value 1) or is a one-shot (value 0).
```
```
fadeOut 3
Fade out to apply when a sample is retriggered, in
milliseconds.
```
```
fadeIn 3 Fade in to apply when a sample is retriggered, in
milliseconds.
gap 3 Gap (silence) between fade out and fade in, in milliseconds.
retriggerOnSampleChange 1 See below.
```

```
Setting Default Description
```
```
fixedPitch 0
Play the sample at a fixed pitch, not controlled by the pitch
CV (if any).
ramp 0 Switch Output B to emit a ramp CV.
triggers 0 Switch Output B to emit trigger pulses.
```
```
clocks 4
Set the number of clocks per loop for the Clocked Audio
Playback algorithm.
```
```
wavelength 600
Set the number of sample frames per waveform for the
Wavetable VCO algorithm.
natural 0 The file's natural pitch as a MIDI note number.
switch 0 The file's switch point as a MIDI note number.
playToCompletion 0 Prevents a one-shot sample being retriggered while playing.
```
```
useStartOnSampleChange 0
Whether switching to a new sample continues from an
equivalent playback position or restarts.
startQuantize 0 Sets the quantisation of the start position.
useLoopMarkers 1 Use loop markers from the WAV file, if available.
```
The fades are useful when retriggering samples, especially when starting them at arbitrary points
within the sample, to avoid clicks. However, for maximum responsiveness when triggering, say,
drum samples, set the fades and gap to zero.

The default behaviour (with retriggerOnSampleChange=1) when selecting a new sample
(via S or Z depending on algorithm) is to immediately begin playing the new sample. If a sample
has retriggerOnSampleChange=0 (or, if the default is set to 0) then the next sample does not
begin playback until triggered by the input. A typical use case for this would be when you have a
set of one-shot (say, drum) samples and you want to trigger each sample and have it play until the
next trigger, not changing in the middle if the sample select CV changes. At an extreme, you could
in this case feed white noise into the sample select CV, to choose a random sample on each trigger.

The fixedPitch setting is a floating point number, where 1.0 corresponds to playing the sample
at its natural speed, 0.5 means play it at half speed etc. fixedPitch=0 (the default) means that
the sample respects the CV-controlled pitch.

ramp=1 outputs a rising ramp from 0V to +8V corresponding to the current position in the sample.
ramp=-1 outputs a falling ramp (+8V to 0V).

triggers outputs a number of triggers during the sample e.g. triggers=4 will output 4 trigger
pulses, equally spaced over the sample length. The triggers are +5V pulses lasting about 10ms. The
maximum number of triggers per sample is 32767. This video demonstrates the triggers feature:

```
Video
```
ramp and triggers are mutually exclusive. The last setting in the playlist file for a given sample
is the one that takes effect.

natural and switch are used only by the Multisample Audio Playback algorithm (see below).

playToCompletion applies to one-shot (non-looping) samples only. If set, the sample can not
be retriggered, either by a trigger CV or by the current sample changing, until it has played all the
way through.

useStartOnSampleChange controls the behaviour when the current sample is changed,
without an explicit trigger (e.g. when turning the Z knob in the I-1 Audio Playback algorithm).


When this is 0 (the default), the new sample starts playing at the same point relative to the start as
the previous sample. When set to 1, the new sample starts at the point defined by the start position
CV (if the algorithm has one) or at the beginning.

startQuantize applies to any algorithm where playback can be retriggered and which provides
a CV for the start position. The length of the file will be equally divided into the number of steps set
by startQuantize, and retriggering will restart playback at the start of one of these steps. For
example if you have a one bar loop (in 4/4 time) and specify startQuantize=4 then playback
will always be triggered at the beginning of a beat within the sample.

The maximum number of sample files per playlist is 100. Files beyond that limit are ignored.

### MIDI Playlist Format....................................

A MIDI playlist file might look something like this:

```
disting playlist v
-zeroVNote=
bach_2ptinv.mid
CDE_bend.mid
-bendRange=
CDE_bend.mid
-loop=
cc1_2.mid
-cc1offset=-1.
-cc1scale=
-cc2offset=
-cc2scale=
```
This breaks down as:

- The header: "disting playlist v1"
- Default settings (optional)
- List of MIDI files
- Per-file settings after each file (optional)

Files may appear more than once in the playlist, with the same or different settings.

Settings are in the format "-" <setting name> "=" <setting value>

Settings that appear before any MIDI file apply globally to all the files in the playlist, unless
overridden by the per-file settings.

The available settings are as follows.

```
Setting Default Description
```
```
loop 1
Whether the MIDI file loops (value 1) or is a one-shot
(value 0).
```
```
zeroVNote 48
MIDI note number corresponding to zero Volts output pitch
CV.
bendRange 2 Pitch bend range, in semitones.
cc1offset 0 Offset for CC#1, in Volts.
cc1scale 5 Range for CC#1, in Volts.
cc2offset 0 Offset for CC#2, in Volts.
cc2scale 5 Range for CC#2, in Volts.
```

```
retriggerOnSampleChange 1 See below.
```
The default behaviour (with retriggerOnSampleChange=1) when selecting a new file is to
immediately begin playing the new file. If a file has retriggerOnSampleChange=0 (or, if the
default is set to 0) then the next file not begin playback until triggered by the input.

The maximum number of MIDI files per playlist is 32. Files beyond that limit are ignored.

### Example Files...............................................

A simple example playlist and some audio files which are known to be formatted correctly can be
downloaded here^4.

### MIDI/CV conversion....................................

The are three primary modes of MIDI/CV conversion, which can be mixed within a MIDI file:

1. Note on/off messages, and pitch bend messages, are used to generate a pitch CV from output
   A and a gate CV from output B.
2. The two highest MIDI notes (126 & 127, aka Fâ¯9 & G9) are converted to gates on outputs A
   & B respectively. The amplitude of the gates is 5V scaled by the note velocity.
3. CCs #1 & #2 are used to directly control voltages on outputs A & B respectively. The 7 bit
   CC value (0-127) is converted to a voltage according to the scale and offset settings (by
   default, 0-5V).

## Scala Support.....................................................

Some disting algorithms support microtonal scales, using files generated by the program Scala^5. The
files are loaded from the MicroSD card. See 'Supported MicroSD cards' above.

### Organising the files on the card....................

To use Scala with the disting, you will need a MicroSD card set up as follows.

- **An 'scl' folder.** A folder named 'scl' in the root folder of the card, which contains all the
  scale (.scl) files that you wish to use. Note: you are advised not to simply unzip the archive
  of over 4000 scales available from the Scala website onto the card â you will find the disting
  slow to load scales if you do.
- **A 'kbm' folder.** A folder named 'kbm' in the root folder of the card, which contains all the
  keyboard mapping (.kbm) files that you wish to use.
- **The log tables.** The disting uses precomputed mathematical tables when processing the
  Scala files. Download the file 'logTables_16_20.bin' from here^6 and place it in the root of
  your SD card.
- **The playlist.** A file named 'playlist-scales.txt' which tells the disting which scales to use.

### Example Files...............................................

A zip file containing some example files, which are known to work, is here^7.

### Scale Playlist Format....................................

A scale playlist file might look something like this:

```
disting playlist v
-kbm=example.kbm
equal.scl
pyth_7a.scl
pyth_12.scl
johnson_7.scl
-kbm=7.kbm
equal.scl
-kbm=root+fifth.kbm
```
This breaks down as:

- The header: "disting playlist v1"
- Default settings (optional)
- List of scale files
- Per-file settings after each file (optional)

Files may appear more than once in the playlist, with the same or different settings.

Settings are in the format "-" <setting name> "=" <setting value>

Settings that appear before any scale file apply globally to all the files in the playlist, unless
overridden by the per-file settings.

Currently there is only one setting, which is the name of the keyboard mapping file to use with the
scale file.

### Possible Sources of Error.............................

If there is a problem reading or interpreting the scale files, the disting will not be able to use them.
Possible things to check include:

- The scale and keyboard mapping files must obviously be valid Scala format files, that the
  Scala application itself will load successfully.
- The scale and keyboard mapping must match â for example, the keyboard mapping must not
  refer to scale degrees that the scale does not have.
- For the keyboard mapping files, the reference frequency must be given for a note that is
  actually mapped.

### A-1 Precision Adder.....................................

```
Video
A = X + Y + offset, or X + offset
B = X â Y â offset, or Y Â± offset
offset = Â±10V in 1V steps derived from Z
Knob recorder enabled
Parameter MinMax DefaultDescription
0 0 1 0 Z Mode.
1 0 2 0 Sum Mode.
```
Outputs A & B are simple sums of inputs X & Y and an offset, according to parameter 1:

```
Parameter
value
```
```
Output A Output B Notes
```
```
0 Sum of inputs X &
Y, plus the offset.
```
```
Difference between inputs
X & Y, minus the offset.
```
```
With nothing plugged into input X,
B is therefore simply an inverted
copy of Y.
1 X plus the offset. Y minus the offset. This is particularly useful for
shifting between bipolar (e.g. Â±5V)
and unipolar (e.g. 0-10V) CVs and
back again.
2 X plus the offset. Y plus the offset.
```
The Z knob/CV sets an offset which is applied to both A and B. The offset is a whole number of
Volts. If X/Y are 1V/Octave pitch CVs, Z is therefore an octave shift control. The maximum shift is
10V, positive or negative.

When Z changes, the offset is shown on the display. After a short while the display reverts to
showing the current algorithm.

When parameter 0 is 1, the offset is not restricted to 1V steps, and changes smoothly with Z.

### A-2 Four Quadrant Multiplier......................

```
Video
A = X * Y * scale
B = -X * Y * scale
scale = 1/10 to 10x in steps derived from Z
Knob recorder enabled
Parameter MinMax DefaultDescription
0 0 1 0 Z Mode.
1 -10 10 0 Y Offset.
```
Output A is the result of multiplying inputs X & Y. Output B is the inverse of output A.

If for example X is a signal and Y is an envelope, then this algorithm is a VCA. If both inputs are
signals, then this is a ring modulator.


The Z knob/CV sets a scale factor which is applied to both outputs. The scale is an integer (whole
number) which either multiplies or divides the result, and ranges in value from 1-10.

When Z changes, the scale is shown on the display. If the value shown is negative, it is a divisor
rather than a multiplier. Note that there is no value of "-1" since dividing by 1 and multiplying by 1
are the same. After a short while the display reverts to showing the current algorithm.

When parameter 0 is 1, the scale is not restricted to integer steps, and changes smoothly with Z.

Parameter 1 applies an offset to the Y input, in whole Volts. This is convenient if you just want to
multiply the X input by a constant, which you can then dial in with the Y Offset and Z.

### A-3 Full-wave Rectifier................................

```
Video
A = abs( X + Y ) or abs( X )
B = abs( X - Y ) or abs( Y )
Z selects mode
```
This algorithm provides a full-wave rectifier or absolute value function. The Z knob/CV select
between one of two modes. In 'independent' mode, A and B are the absolute values of X and Y,
respectively. In 'combined' mode, A is the absolute value of the sum of X & Y; B is the absolute
value of the difference of X & Y.

When Z changes, the mode is displayed. 'Independent' mode is shown as "-0"; 'combined' mode as
"0". After a short while the display reverts to showing the current algorithm.

### A-4 Minimum/maximum..............................

```
Video
A = min( X, Y )
B = max( X, Y )
Z is gate
```
Output A is the minimum of inputs X & Y; output B is the maximum of the two inputs. If one input
is zero (or disconnected), this is a half-wave rectifier.

The Z knob/CV provides a gate function. When Z goes higher than approximately 2.5V, the gate
goes high and the outputs follow the inputs according to the min/max relationship. When Z goes
below approximately -1.5V, the gate goes low and the outputs are frozen.

When the gate changes state, "LO" or "HI" is displayed to indicate the gate status. After a short
while the display reverts to showing the current algorithm.


### A-5 Linear/Exponential Converter...............

```
Video
A = ( 2 ^ X ) * scale
B = log2( Y / scale )
Z is Hz/V scale, centred on 1kHz
Parameter MinMax Default Description
0 0 1 0 Type A.
1 0 1 0 Type B.
```
This algorithm provides a linear-to-exponential converter and an exponential-to-linear converter.
You might use this to interface 1V/octave modules (Eurorack standard) with Hz/V synths (e.g. old
Korg or Yamaha synths), but it could also be useful within Eurorack e.g. to convert an LFO
(commonly with Hz/V pitch control) to a V/octave oscillator, or to convert an exponential FM input
on a VCO into a linear FM input.

Input X is the exponential input; its corresponding linear output is A. Y is the linear input, whose
exponential output is B.

Z sets the scale factor which is common to both conversions. It sets the number of Hz per Volt, with
arrange from near zero to about 2kHz. The Yamaha CS-15, for example, uses about 1100Hz/V,
which is about half way on the Z knob here.

The zero Volt point on the exponential scale used is C3 (approximately 130.81Hz).

Parameters 0 & 1 switch their respective outputs to function as gate inverters. (Some old synths e.g.
the Korg MS-20 have a Hz/V pitch input and an inverted gate, compared to the Eurorack norm.)
The output is then 5V/0V for an input gate in excess of 1V.

### A-6 Quantizer...............................................

```
Video
A = quantized( X )
B = trigger on note change
Z chooses scale & function of Y
Y = transpose (Z positive) or trigger (Z negative)
Outputs & Receives MIDI
Parameter MinMax Default Description
0 -1 31 31 Input X attenuation.
1 0 1 0 Transpose mode.
2 -31 31 0 Key.
3 0 31 0 Offset.
4 0 1 0 MIDI Gate.
```
Output A is a quantized version of input X; the closest whole-semitone value to the unquantized
V/octave pitch CV X. Output B is a trigger signal which fires whenever output A changes - a 5V
pulse approximately 10ms long.

As well as providing a chromatic scale, this algorithm can also constrain the quantized values to a
musical scale or chord. This is controlled by the Z knob/CV.


When Z changes, the scale is displayed on the LEDs. The scale's number in the following table is
shown, and after a short pause, the scale's name.

```
Number Scale Displayed name
0 chromatic Chromatic
1 major scale Major
2 minor scale Minor
3 major triad Triad
4 minor triad 3b+5
5 root+5th Fifth
6 major triad+6th Triad+6
7 minor triad+6th 3b+5+6
8 major triad+7th Triad+7
9 minor triad+7th 3b+5+7
10 root+5th+6th 5+6
11 root+5th+7th 5+7
12 pentatonic major Pent
13 pentatonic minor Minor Pent
14 natural minor scale Nat Minor
15 harmonic minor scale Harm Minor
```
A further option is controlled by Z being positive or negative. When Z is negative, the scale number
is shown as a negative value.

**When Z is positive** input Y is a transpose control. The CV on input Y is quantized (to a chromatic
scale) and added to the quantized result in one of two ways, controlled by parameter 1. If parameter
1 is zero, the transposition is applied to output A, after input X has been quantized to the chosen
scale. If parameter 1 is one, the transposition is applied to input X before it is forced into the chosen
scale. So, in mode zero the overall key of the quantization is transposed, whereas in mode one the
transposition moves the notes around within the same key.

**When Z is negative** input Y is a trigger. In this mode, input X is only sampled and converted to a
new quantized value when input Y rises over approximately 1V. (In non-triggered mode, X is
constantly sampled and a new note is output as soon as X moves into the next semitone range.)

Parameter 2 sets the root **key** of the chosen scale. At zero, the first note of the scale (e.g. C in the
key of C) corresponds to 0V. If the parameter is set for example to 2, the first note of the scale is at
2/12 = 0.1667V - or to look at it another way, if your VCO is tuned so that 0V gives you a C, the
quantizer is now working in the key of D (D major, minor, triad etc. depending on the scale setting).

Parameter 3 sets an offset between the timing of the X & Y inputs (in sample frames). When using
Y as a trigger, it is often a good idea to delay it slightly relative to the pitch, to ensure that the pitch
has changed and settled before the trigger samples a new note.

**MIDI Output** : each new note (i.e. when the Output B trigger fires) is output as a MIDI note
message on the MIDI channel selected in the settings.

Parameter 4 controls when note off messages are sent. If parameter 4 is zero (the default), the note
off is sent just before the note on â so the note lasts from one change to the next, which is
conceptually the same as the CV output. If parameter 4 is one, and Z is negative (so Y is a trigger),
then the trigger is treated as a gate, and the note off message is sent when the gate goes low.


**MIDI Input** : MIDI note messages received on MIDI channel 1 set parameter 2 (root key).

### A-7 Comparator............................................

```
Video
A = gate from X > Y
B = inverted gate
Z is hysteresis
```
Output A is a gate signal (zero or +5V), high when input X has a higher voltage than input Y.
Output B is an inverted copy of A (i.e. +5V when A is 0V and vice versa.)

The Z knob/CV input sets the hysteresis (for an explanation of hysteresis see here). Inputs of
approximately 0-4V correspond to hysteresis values of approximately 0-10V. Negative values are
clamped at zero.

### A-8 Dual Waveshaper..................................

```
Video
A = shaped X
B = shaped Y
Z is gain
Knob recorder enabled
ParameterMin Max Default Description
0 0 1 0 Type A.
1 0 1 1 Type B.
```
This algorithm provides two independent waveshaping functions. The Z knob/CV is a gain control,
with a range of approximately 30x. Negative values of Z invert the signal.

Output A provides a waveshaped version of input X; output B provides a waveshaped version of
input Y.

Parameters 0 & 1 choose what type of waveshaping is applied.

Type 0 is what is usually termed a wavefolder. This increases the harmonic content of the sound in
interesting ways, especially as the gain changes.

Type 1 is a triangle-to-sine waveshaper. Used on most audio this is a relatively gentle form of
overdrive/saturation. However, when fed with the right level of triangle wave, the output is exactly
a sine wave, which is useful when you have a triangle wave VCO handy but really want a pure sine
wave instead.


### B-1 Sample and Hold...................................

```
Video
A = X when Y exceeds 1V
B = noise Â±8V
Z is slew rate
ParameterMin Max Default Description
0 0 1 0 Mode.
1 0 31 0 Offset.
2 0 3 1 Noise colour.
3 0 64 0 Noise X.
4 0 32 32 Atten B.
5 -1 31 -1 Up slew.
6 -1 31 -1 Down slew.
```
**If parameter 0 is 0 (the default)** :
Output A is a sample of input X, taken when the trigger input Y goes over 1V. (Sample and Hold)
**If parameter 0 is 1** :
Output A follows input X while input Y is over 1V. When Y falls below 0.5V, output A is held
until Y goes over 1V again. (Track and Hold)

Output B is a noise signal. Noise is commonly fed into the input of a sample and hold device to
generate clocked random voltages. The amplitude of output B is set by parameter 4; the maximum
is Â±8V.

Parameter 2 controls the noise colour:

```
Parameter value Noise colour
0 Violet
1 White
2 Pink
3 Red
```
The Z knob/CV controls the slew rate of output A. At the minimum value of Z, changes in A are
instantaneous. As Z increases, changes in A take place more slowly.

Parameters 5 & 6 allow you to specify different slew rates when the signal rises or falls. If the
parameter is -1, the slew time is set from Z; otherwise the slew is set from the parameter value.

Pressing the Z knob triggers a sample manually.

Parameter 1 sets an offset between the timing of the X & Y inputs (in sample frames). If X & Y are
being driven together, for example by a sequencer's pitch and gate, it is often a good idea to delay
the trigger slightly to allow time for the sampled CV to settle before the sample is taken.

Parameter 3 adds the noise output into the input signal, equivalent to patching output B into input X
via an attenuator.


### B-2 Slew Rate Limiter..................................

```
Video
A = slew rate limited ( X + Y ) or X
B = slew rate limited ( X + Y ) or Y
Z is slew rate
ParameterMin MaxDefault Description
0 -1 32 -1 Up slew.
1 -1 32 -1 Down slew.
2 0 1 0 Type A.
3 0 1 1 Type B.
4 0 1 0 Mode.
```
Outputs A & B are slew rate limited versions of X & Y. If parameter 4 is 0, they are both based on
the sum of X + Y; if parameter 4 is 1, A is based on X, and B is based on Y.

Parameters 2 & 3 choose the type of slew rate limiting applied to A & B respectively. A parameter
value of 0 gives linear slew rate limiting; a step change in the input will typically result in a ramp
output, until the output reaches its desired value, at which point it will be constant. A parameter
value of 1 gives logarithmic slew rate limiting; a step change in input results in a smooth curve that
gradually approaches the desired value.

The Z knob/CV controls the slew rate for both outputs. At the minimum value of Z, changes are
very rapid. As Z increases, changes take place more slowly.

Parameters 0 & 1 allow for independent control of the slew times when the signal is rising or
falling. If each parameter is -1, the corresponding slew rate is controlled by Z. Otherwise, the slew
rate is set by the parameter value.

### B-3 Pitch and Envelope Tracker...................

```
Video
A = V/octave pitch derived from X, plus Y
B = envelope dervied from X
Z is slew rate for envelope
```
This algorithm provides pitch and envelope tracking of an incoming audio signal. It will track
frequencies down to about 27Hz, which is just below the lowest note on a standard 88 key piano.

Output A is a 1V/octave pitch CV reflecting the pitch of the signal on input X. The 0V point is C3
(approximately 130.81Hz). Input Y is simply added to the pitch CV, providing a means of applying
e.g. vibrato, or transposition.

Output B tracks the envelope of the signal on input X. It goes to zero when the algorithm fails to
track a pitch.

Knob/CV Z sets the slew rate of the envelope, controlling how quickly it tracks changes in level. At
the minimum value of Z, changes can be very rapid, which may produce undesirable effects,
especially if pitch tracking is not working well. As Z increases, changes take place more slowly.


### B-4 Clockable Delay/Echo...........................

```
Video
X is signal
Y is clock input
Z is feedback
A = output according to mode
B = output according to mode
Tap tempo enabled
```
```
Parameter MinMax Default Description
0 -15 8 0 Delay time multiplier.
1 0 2 0 Output mode.
```
This algorithm is a delay/echo effect, primarily intended for processing audio signals, where the
delay time is set from a clock pulse. It operates at a quarter of the standard sample rate (i.e. at about
19kHz) and offers a maximum delay time of about 1700ms.

Input X is the signal input. Any audio signal can be fed in here.

Input Y is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. The time between rising
trigger edges is used to set the delay time. If the time between triggers is greater than the maximum
delay time, the time is divided by two until it is small enough. This way, you always end up with a
rhythmically useful delay time.

The Z knob/CV controls the feedback, from zero to slightly more than 100%.

Outputs A & B carry signals according to parameter 1:

```
Parameter value Output mode
0 A is mix; B is delay only.
1 A & B are mix.
2 A & B are delay only.
```
'Mix' is a mix of the dry (undelayed) signal and the delay effect. The amount of delay in the mix
rises in direct proportion to the amount of feedback.

'Delay only' is the delayed signal only. Use this and the input signal, plus an external mixer, if you
need more flexibility in the dry/wet balance than is offered by the mixed mode.

The first parameter applies a multiplier to the delay time, according to the following table:

```
Parameter valueMultiplierParameter valueMultiplierParameter valueMultiplier
-15 1/64 -7 3/16 1 x1.5
-14 1/48 -6 1/4 2 x2
-13 1/32 -5 5/16 3 x3
-12 1/24 -4 1/3 4 x4
-11 1/16 -3 3/8 5 x5
-10 1/12 -2 1/2 6 x6
-9 1/8 -1 3/4 7 x8
-8 1/6 0 x1 8 x16
```

### B-5 LFO........................................................

Outputs A & B are LFOs (low frequency oscillators), with CV control of frequency and waveshape.
The output signals are Â±8V (16V peak-to-peak) by default, but can be attenuated via the parameters.

The outputs can also have a DC offset applied. The offset in Volts is (parameter value)/4 i.e. the
range is Â±10V, in steps of 0.25V.

Input X is a Hz/V frequency control, scaled at 1Hz/V. Note that the input is allowed to go negative,
resulting in a phase-reversed output.

Knob/CV Z is a tuning control, with a range of approximately Â±10Hz. This is simply added to the
setting from input X (so with input X disconnected, the knob can be used to manually set an LFO
rate).

Input Y controls the waveshape of the output signals. Signals in the range Â±5V give the full range of
possible waveshapes:

```
Input Y -5V 0V +5V
Output A saw sine triangle
```
```
Output B 0% duty cycle pulse50% duty cycle pulse
(square)
100% duty cycle pulse
```
Parameter 4 offsets the Y input, providing a way to set the waveshape manually.

```
ParameterMin MaxDefault Description
0 -32 32 32 Output A attenuverter.
1 -32 32 32 Output B attenuverter.
2 -32 32 0 Y Offset.
```
Outputs A & B are LFOs (low frequency oscillators), with CV control of waveshape, and with the
LFO cycle time set from a clock input. The output signals are Â±8V (16V peak-to-peak) by default,
but can be attenuated and inverted via parameters 0 & 1.

Input X is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. The time between rising
trigger edges is used to set the cycle time.

Input Y controls the waveshape of the output signals. Signals in the range Â±5V give the full range of
possible waveshapes:

```
Input Y -5V 0V +5V
Output A saw sine triangle
```
```
Output B 0% duty cycle pulse
50% duty cycle pulse
(square)
100% duty cycle pulse
```
Parameter 2 is an offset added to the Y CV, allowing manual selection of the waveshape.

The Z knob/CV sets a scale factor which is applied to the cycle time. The scale is an integer (whole
number) which either multiplies or divides the frequency, and ranges in value from 1-16.

When Z changes, the scale is shown on the display. If the value shown is negative, it is a divisor
rather than a multiplier. Note that there is no value of "-1" since dividing by 1 and multiplying by 1
are the same.


#### B-7 VCO with linear FM..............................

```
Video
X is V/Oct pitch input
Y is linear FM input
Z is tune Â±0.5 octaves
A & B are selectable output waveforms
Receives MIDI
Parameter MinMax Default Description

2 0 32 32 Sets an attenuation for output B.
3 0 5 1 Type A.
4 0 5 3 Type B.
```
This algorithm is a VCO with a 1V/octave pitch CV input (X), and a linear FM input (Y), scaled at
100Hz/V. Note that, if the FM input goes sufficiently negative, it will take the frequency through
and below zero, resulting in a phase inversion ("thru-zero FM").

The 0V point for the pitch input is C3 (approximately 130.81Hz).

The Z knob/CV provides a tuning control, with a range of approximately Â±0.5 octaves.

The A and B outputs provide waveforms according to the following table:

```
Parameter value Waveform
0 Triangle.
1 Sine.
2 Square.
3 Saw.
4 Sub-octave square.
5 MIDI gate.
```
Parameters 3 & 4 control the waveform of outputs A & B respectively. The output signals are Â±8V
(16V peak-to-peak) by default, but can be attenuated via parameters 1 & 2.

**MIDI Input** : MIDI note messages received on the MIDI channel set in the Settings are converted to
a CV which is added to that on input X. The 0V note is 48 (C3). MIDI notes also drive the 'MIDI
gate' output option.


#### B-8 VCO with waveshaping.........................

```

Z is tune Â±0.5 octaves or sync
A & B are selectable output waveforms

4 0 4 0 Selects output waveforms.
5 -12 12 0 Transpose.
6 -51 50 -51 Fine tune/enable sync.
```
This algorithm is a VCO with a 1V/octave pitch CV input (X), and waveshape/PWM input (Y).

The 0V point for the pitch input is C3 (approximately 130.81Hz).

The Z knob/CV provides a tuning control, with a range of approximately Â±0.5 octaves (but see also
parameter 6, below).

Parameter 4 selects the output waveforms according to the following table:

```
Parameter value WaveformA WaveformB
0 Triangle/saw Square/pulse
1 Triangle/saw Sub-octave square
2 Square/pulse Sub-octave square
3 Triangle/saw MIDI gate.
4 Square/pulse MIDI gate.
```
Input Y controls the waveshape of the output signals. Signals in the range Â±5V give the full range of
possible waveshapes:

```
Input Y -5V 0V +5V
Triangle/saw saw (falling) triangle saw (rising)
```
```
Square/pulse 0% duty cycle pulse
50% duty cycle pulse
(square)
100% duty cycle pulse
```
The output signals are Â±8V (16V peak-to-peak) by default, but can be attenuated via parameters 1
and 2.

Parameter 3 offsets the Y input, effectively providing a manual shape control if required.

Parameter 5 transposes the VCO pitch, in semitone increments.

Parameter 6 controls the function of Z. At the default value of -51, Z is the tune control as already


mentioned. When the parameter is set to a value from -50 to 50, Z no longer affects the tuning, and
the parameter value is used as a fine tune control, in cents. Z then becomes a sync input: when Z
goes over approximately 1V, the VCO phase is reset to zero, which can produce 'oscillator sync'
sounds^8.

**MIDI Input** : MIDI note messages received on the MIDI channel set in the Settings are converted to
a CV which is added to that on input X. The 0V note is 48 (C3). MIDI notes also drive the 'MIDI
gate' output option.

#### C-1 Precision Adder (fractional offsets).......

B = X - Y - offset

Knob recorder enabled
ParameterMin MaxDefault Description

1 0 2 0 Sum mode.
```
This algorithm is basically the same as A-1 Precision Adder above, except that where the other
algorithm has offsets in steps of 1V, this algorithm allows you to set a divisor for the offset. This
defaults to 12, so when used to offset a 1V/octave pitch CV the offsets correspond to semitones.

#### C-2 Voltage Controlled Delay Line..............

```
Video
X is audio input
Y is delay time
Z is feedback (bipolar)
A is delay output
B is delay output plus input signal
ParameterMin Max Default Description
0 -32 32 0 Applies an offset to the Y input.
1 -32 32 32 Attenuator for the Y input.
2 0 1 0 Enable saturation.
```
This algorithm is a voltage controlled delay line, with a maximum delay time of just over 200ms.
As well as simple echoes, this can produce a wide variety of effects such as vibrato, chorus and
flange.

A control signal of 0-8V on the Y input sets the delay time, with a linear voltage/time relationship.
Parameter 0 can be used to set this to a 'centre' value, which makes it easier to patch in an LFO to
the Y input without having to add a DC offset to the LFO.

Parameter 1 is an attenuverter for Y, applied before the offset.

Z is a feedback control. It is zero at 0V input, and provides negative feedback for negative voltages.

A outputs the delay signal only. Use this for vibrato effects, or if you want a controllable mix of dry

8 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillator_sync


and delayed signal.

B outputs the delay and dry signals mixed in equal amounts. In combination with an LFO on the
delay time, this is the quickest route to chorus/flange type effects.

Parameter 2 enables a saturation stage on the input to the delay line. This can prevent unpleasant
distortion when the feedback becomes high, at the expense of some colouration of the sound.

#### C-3 Clockable Ping Pong Delay (Z feedback)

This algorithm is a stereo ping-pong delay/echo effect, primarily intended for processing audio
signals, where the delay time is set from a clock pulse. It operates at a quarter of the standard
sample rate (i.e. at about 19kHz) and offers a maximum delay time of about 900ms.

Input X is the signal input. Any audio signal can be fed in here.

Input Y is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. The time between rising
trigger edges is used to set the delay time. If the time between triggers is greater than the maximum
delay time, the time is divided by two until it is small enough. This way, you always end up with a
rhythmically useful delay time.

Parameter 1 applies a multiplier to the delay time, according to the table above.

The Z knob/CV controls the feedback, from zero to slightly more than 100%.

Outputs A & B are the left and right outputs respectively. If the output mode parameter is 0 (the
default), they are a mix of the dry (undelayed) signal and the delay effect. The amount of delay in
the mix rises in direct proportion to the amount of feedback. If the output mode parameter is 1, the
outputs are the delayed signals only. Use this and the input signal, plus an external mixer, if you
need more flexibility in the dry/wet balance than is offered by output mode 0.

Parameter 2 controls the left/right pan position of the input signal.

The delay feedback is set via parameter 0.

#### C-5 Resonator...............................................

```
Video
X is audio or trigger input
Y is centre frequency (pitch)
Z is gain
A is audio output
B is envelope of audio output
Z press is 'strike'
```
```
ParameterMin Max Default Description
0 -32 32 0 Applies an offset to the Y input.
1 0 1 0 Mode.
```
This algorithm implements a resonator, which is a kind of filter, but which is also often found as the


basis for analogue drum synthesis.

X is the input for the signal to filter. If used as a drum synth, this is the trigger input. The amplitude
and nature of the trigger signal will affect the resulting sound. If parameter 1 is set to '1', the input is
treated as an actual trigger, not an audio signal, triggering a pulse when the input goes over 1V.

Y sets the pitch of the resonator, with a 1V/octave response. The 0V point for the pitch input is C3
(approximately 130.81Hz). Parameter 0 provides a pitch offset in semitones.

Z sets the gain. In terms of drum synthesis, more gain means a longer decay time.

A is the audio output.

B outputs the result of envelope tracking the audio output A.

Pressing Z simulates hitting X with a 1ms 5V pulse, and so works as a manual trigger of the 'drum'.

#### C-6 Vocoder.................................................

```
Video
X is modulator input
Y is carrier input
Z sets the decay time
A is audio output
B is envelope output
Parameter MinMax Default Description
0 0 1 0 Selects the filter bank.
1 0 64 16 Output A attenuation/gain.
2 0 64 16 Output B attenuation/gain.
```
This algorithm implements a vocoder. The spectral characteristics of the modulator input are
applied to the carrier input. In classic usage, the modulator might be a human voice, and the carrier
might be a synth sound, or simply noise.

X is the modulator input, and Y is the carrier input.

A is the audio output. B outputs a CV related to the envelope of the modulator signal.

The Z control sets the decay time of the internal envelope trackers, which track each band of the
modulator signal. Use low values (negative Z) for most intelligible speech.

Parameter 0 selects between alternative filter banks:

```
Bank Description
0 Half octave spacing, based on 100Hz.
1 Third octave spacing, based on 250Hz.
```
Parameters 1 & 2 provide attenuation or gain of outputs A & B respectively.


#### C-7 Phaser.....................................................

```
Video
X is audio input
Y is sweep
Z is feedback (bipolar)
A is phase-shifted output plus input signal
B is phase-shifted output
Parameter MinMax Default Description
0 -31 31 0 Applies an offset to the Y input.
1 1 10 10 Sets the number of phaser stages.
```
This algorithm implements a phase shifter or 'phaser' effect.

X is the audio input.

Y is the sweep input. 0V to 8V covers the whole range; negative voltages are treated as 0V. You
will almost always want to patch an LFO in here. Parameter 0 can be used to set this to a 'centre'
value, which makes it easier to patch in an LFO to the Y input without having to add a DC offset to
the LFO.

Z controls feedback. More feedback results in more extreme phasing effects. When Z is negative,
the feedback is inverted, which gives a different-sounding phasing effect.

A outputs the combination of the phase-shifted signal and the original signal, which is usually what
you need for a classic phaser effect, since it's the interaction of the original signal and the phase-
shifted version which produces the 'comb filtering' effect.

Output B provides just the phase shifted signal, if you need more contorl over how this and the
original signal are mixed.

Parameter 1 sets the number of phase shifting stages. The more stages, the more notches there are in
the comb filter, which results in a more pronounced effect.

#### C-8 Bit Crusher.............................................

```
Video
X is signal input
Y is sample rate input
Z sets bit reduction
A is signal output
B is comparator output
```
```
ParameterMin Max Default Description
0 -31 31 0 Applies an offset to the Y input.
1 0 7 0 Selects the bit reduction mode.
2 0 7 0 Selects the bit mangling mode.
```
This algorithm is a 'bit crusher' - it applies sample rate and sample depth reduction to deliberately
introduce quantisation and aliasing artefacts. It also optionally applies bitwise modification of the
samples for non-linear distortion effects.

X is the signal input.


Y is the sample rate reduction CV input. It has a 1V/octave response i.e. the sample rate is reduced
by a factor of 2 for every 1V rise in CV. This CV is offset by parameter 0, so you can set a rate
reduction without a CV input.

A is the signal output.

B is the output of a comparator. Output A is compared against zero; output B is +5V if A is above
zero, or 0V if A is below zero.

The Z control sets the bit depth reduction. There are two types of bit reduction available:

- **Type I** - the signal is quantised to a 16 bit word, and the low bits thrown away. The
  resulting signal uses a power of 2 bits. Changing between bit depths is therefore
  discontinous.
- **Type II** - quantisation is achieved via the limited precision of integer maths when dividing
  the signal by a factor. Since the factor can be continuously varied, this offers a smooth
  variation between 'bit depths'.

Furthermore, positive and negative values of Z have different effects.

- Positive Z treats the whole signal range as one number to be quantised.
- Negative Z treats positive and negative sections of the input signal differently. Negative
  sections are flipped positive, quantized, and flipped back.

Parameter 1 selects the type of bit reduction. The positive and negative sections of the input signal
can have different types of reduction applied.

```
Parameter 1 value Positive signal Positive signal
0 Type I Type I
1 Type II Type II
2 Type I Type II
3 Type II Type I
4 Type I None
5 Type II None
6 None Type I
7 None Type II
```
Parameter 2 selects the bit mangling mode.

```
Parameter 2 value Bit mangling
0 None
1 Bit swap variant 1
2 Bit swap variant 2
3 Bit swap variant 3
4 Bit rotation
5 Previous sample XOR variant 1
6 Previous sample XOR variant 2

#### D-1 DJ Filter.................................................

```
Video
X & Y are stereo audio input
A & B are stereo audio output
Z is filter sweep
ParameterMin Max Default Description
0 0 31 0 Filter resonance.
```
This is stereo filter which sweeps from lowpass to highpass on a single knob.

The Z knob/CV sets the filter cutoff. At the central, zero position no filter effect is applied. If the
knob is turned anticlockwise, a lowpass filter is applied, with a cutoff frequency that sweeps down
the more you turn. If the knob is turned clockwise from centre, a highpass filter is applied, with a
cutoff frequency that sweeps up the more you turn.

#### D-2 Tape Delay............................................

X is audio input
Y is tape speed
Z is feedback

B = output according to mode
ParameterMin Max Default Description
0 0 43 43 Tape length.
1 -9 9 0 Fine length control.
2 -8 16 0 Tape speed.
3 0 2 0 Output mode.
```
This is a delay/echo effect which simulates a variable speed tape loop echo device. The delay time
at '1x speed', with the tape length parameter at maximum, is just over 400ms.

X is the audio input.

Parameters 0 & 1 together set the 'tape length', effectively setting the delay time. Parameter 0 is
scaled in 10ms increments, while parameter 1 is in 1ms increments (both assuming 1x 'tape speed').

Y controls the speed of the 'tape', which also affects the delay time. The voltage/speed relationship
is 8V/octave. If you consider 0V as '1x speed', then +8V gives '2x speed' (the maximum) and -4V
gives 'half speed' (the minimum). Parameter 2 can be used to set the speed manually; its value is
added to that of the Y input.

The Z knob/CV controls the feedback, from zero to slightly more than 100%.

Outputs A & B carry signals according to parameter 3:

```
Parameter value Output mode
0 A is mix; B is delay only.
1 A & B are mix.
2 A & B are delay only.
```

'Mix' is a mix of the dry (undelayed) signal and the delay effect. The amount of delay in the mix
rises in direct proportion to the amount of feedback.

'Delay only' is the delayed signal only. Use this and the input signal, plus an external mixer, if you
need more flexibility in the dry/wet balance than is offered by the mixed mode.

#### D-3 Waveform Animator..............................

```
Video
X is audio input
Y is threshold
Z is separation
A = animated output
B = square waves output
ParameterMin MaxDefault Description
0 -1 31 11 LFO depth.
1 -31 31 0 Y offset.
2 0 31 23 LFO rate.
3 -1 31 -1 Scale.
```
This algorithm recreates a popular analogue circuit variously known as a waveform animator or
wave multiplier. Such a circuit, when given (typically) a sawtooth waveform as input, uses a
comparator to generate a square wave of suitable phase and pulsewidth such that when the square
and saw waves are added together the result is a phase shifted saw waveform. This is usually done a
number of times and the results added with the overall effect of turning the original, rather plain,
waveform into a much richer one which to all intents and purposes is the same as if you'd started
with a number of VCOs rather than just one, and so sounds "fatter". In combination with LFOs
varying the comparator thresholds, very rich textures can be generated.

Here, four comparators and four LFOs are used.

X is the audio input.

The thresholds of the comparators are set by a combination of Y and Z. Y sets the 'centre' threshold;
Z sets a 'spread' of the individual thresholds around the centre. Parameter 1 also sets the centre.

Parameter 0 sets the LFO depth. Parameter 2 scales the LFO rates; the four LFOs have preset
individual speeds, which the parameter multiplies.

Parameter 3 sets the 'scale'. The recreation of phase shifted sawtooths works best when the square
wave amplitude is matched to that of the saw. The default setting of -1 uses an envelope tracker to
automatically set the square amplitude from the incoming audio. Other values directly set the
amplitude (31 corresponds to Â±8V). Fixing the amplitude of the square waves and varying the input
signal's amplitude is a useful effect in its own right.

Output A is the animated output (sum of the orignal signal and the comparator outputs). Output B is
just the square waves.

This is a 2nd-order filter, with a voltage controllable response type. By varying Z, the output can be
low pass, band pass or high pass, or blends in between.

X is the audio input.

Y sets the filter frequency, with a 1V/octave response. The 0V point is C3 (approximately
130.81Hz). Parameter 0 is added to the Y CV; its range of Â±80 corresponds to Â±5V.

Z sets the filter type output at A & B.

Output A blends smoothly between low pass (at minimum Z), through band pass (at zero Z), to high
pass (at maximum Z).

Output B blends smoothly between high pass (at minimum Z), through band pass (at zero Z), to low
pass (at maximum Z).

Parameter 1 sets the filter resonance.

6 0 32 26 Attack shape.
7 0 32 10 Release shape.
```
This algorithm is a two-stage (attack/release or attack/decay) envelope generator.

Inputs X & Y are trigger inputs. A signal in excess of 1V on either input will trigger the envelope,
according to the mode set by parameter 0. In trigger mode 0, the envelope will rise to full level and
stay there as long as the input is high (AR mode). In trigger mode 1, the envelope will execute one
full attack/decay cycle in response to a trigger input (AD mode). In trigger mode 2, the envelope
will continually execute attack/decay cycles as long as the trigger is high (looped AD mode).

Z sets the envelope times, according to the mode set by parameter 1. In Z mode 0, the full range of
Z values sweeps from short A & D, through short A & long D, through long A & D, through long A
& short D, and finally back to short A & D. In Z mode 1, Z sets the A & D times to the same value,
from very short times (about 10ms) to very long times (about 8s).

A & B both output the envelope CV. Each has its own attenuverter parameter, which can attenuate
and/or invert the signal. The maximum envelope level is 10V, with the default parameter value of
32 giving an 8V envelope. Each output also has an offset parameter, which can move the whole
envelope up or down by up to 10V.

If parameter 2 is set to the special value 41, output A becomes an end-of-cycle trigger output,
generating a 10ms 5V pulse at the end of the envelope's release stage.

Parameters 6 & 7 set the attack and release shapes of the envelope respectively, from an
exaggerated exponential curve at 0 to an almost linear shape at 32.

Pushing the Z knob has the same effect as triggering the envelope via the X or Y inputs.


**MIDI Input** : Any MIDI note messages received on the MIDI channel set in the Settings trigger the
envelope.

This algorithm is a combined two-stage (attack/release or attack/decay) envelope generator & VCA
(voltage controlled amplifier).

Input X is the trigger input. A signal in excess of 1V will trigger the envelope, according to the
mode set by parameter 0. In trigger mode 0, the envelope will rise to full level and stay there as long
as the input is high (AR mode). In trigger mode 1, the envelope will execute one full attack/decay
cycle in response to a trigger input (AD mode). In trigger mode 2, the envelope will continually
execute attack/decay cycles as long as the trigger is high (looped AD mode).

Trigger modes 3-8 work like modes 1-2 except that the source of the trigger is the tracked envelope
of one of the inputs. Modes 3-5 use input X and modes 6-8 use input Y. So for example mode 6
triggers the envelope generator from the VCA input signal, i.e. the algorithm is behaving as an
'envelope modifier' effect â put a guitar in here for automatic slow swells.

Input Y is the VCA input. The signal here will be multiplied by the envelope and output on output
B.

Z sets the envelope times, according to the mode set by parameter 1. In Z mode 0, the full range of
Z values sweeps from short A & D, through short A & long D, through long A & D, through long A
& short D, and finally back to short A & D. In Z mode 1, Z sets the A & D times to the same value,
from very short times (about 10ms) to very long times (about 8s).

Output A is the envelope CV, and output B is the VCA output as mentioned above. Each has its
own attenuverter parameter, which can attenuate and/or invert the signal. The maximum envelope
level is 10V, with the default parameter value of 32 giving an 8V envelope, which corresponds to
unity gain for the VCA. Each output also has an offset parameter, which can move the whole
envelope up or down by up to 10V.


If parameter 2 is set to the special value 41, output A becomes an end-of-cycle trigger output,
generating a 10ms 5V pulse at the end of the envelope's release stage.

Parameters 6 & 7 set the attack and release shapes of the envelope respectively, from an
exaggerated exponential curve at 0 to an almost linear shape at 32.

Pushing the Z knob has the same effect as triggering the envelope via the X input.

**MIDI Input** : Any MIDI note messages received on the MIDI channel set in the Settings trigger the
envelope.

This algorithm offers dual two-stage (attack/release or attack/decay) envelope generators, with
shared time settings.

Inputs X & Y are trigger inputs. A signal in excess of 1V on either input will trigger its respective
envelope, according to the mode set by parameter 0. In trigger mode 0, the envelope will rise to full
level and stay there as long as the input is high (AR mode). In trigger mode 1, the envelope will
execute one full attack/decay cycle in response to a trigger input (AD mode). In trigger mode 2, the
envelope will continually execute attack/decay cycles as long as the trigger is high (looped AD
mode).

Z sets the envelope times, according to the mode set by parameter 1. In Z mode 0, the full range of
Z values sweeps from short A & D, through short A & long D, through long A & D, through long A
& short D, and finally back to short A & D. In Z mode 1, Z sets the A & D times to the same value,
from very short times (about 10ms) to very long times (about 8s).

A & B are the envelope CV outputs. Each has its own attenuverter parameter, which can attenuate
and/or invert the signal. The maximum envelope level is 10V, with the default parameter value of
32 giving an 8V envelope. Each output also has an offset parameter, which can move the whole
envelope up or down by up to 10V.


Parameters 6 & 7 set the attack and release shapes of the envelope respectively, from an
exaggerated exponential curve at 0 to an almost linear shape at 32.

Pushing the Z knob has the same effect as triggering both envelopes via the X & Y inputs.

**MIDI Input** : Any MIDI note messages received on the MIDI channel set in the Settings trigger
envelope A; any MIDI note messages on the next channel up trigger envelope B.

#### E-4 Stereo Compressor.................................

```

X is left input
Y is right input
A is left output
B is right output
Z is compression ratio
Parameter MinMax Default Description
0 -36 0 -12 Threshold.
1 0 99 20 Attack time.
2 0 99 20 Release time.
3 -1 36 0 Make-up gain.
4 0 99 0 Lookahead.
```
This algorithm implements a fairly traditional stereo compressor.

X & Y are the stereo audio inputs; A & B are the stereo audio outputs.

The Z knob/CV sets the compression ratio, from 1 (no compression) at fully counterclockwise, to
infinity (effectively limiting rather than compression) at fully clockwise.

Parameter 0 sets the threshold level above which compression applies (in dB).

Parameters 1 & 2 set the attack and release times. The attack time range is approximately 0.1ms-1s;
the release time range is approximately 1ms-3s.

Parameter 3 sets the make-up gain (in dB). If set to -1, the make-up gain is calculated automatically
from the threshold and compression ratio.

Parameter 4 sets a lookahead time, effectively delaying the audio slightly relative to the envelope
detection. This can be used to ensure that sharp transients are not lost during the attack time of the
envelope. The maximum lookahead is about 10ms.


#### E-5 Side-chain Compressor..........................

3 -1 36 0 Make-up gain.
4 0 99 0 Lookahead.
5 0 99 50 Compression ratio.
```
This algorithm is much the same as E-4 Stereo Compressor above, except that the gain reduction is
driven not by the audio signal itself, but by a side-chain input. Refer to the description of E-4 for
explanation of the common parameters not detailed below.

The Z knob/CV is the side-chain input. If you're using an audio signal here, you'll want to set the
knob to its central (un-illuminated) position first. However, you can also use Z with any CV to
control the gain reduction directly.

Parameter 5 sets the compression ratio, with a range from 1 (no compression) to infinity (effectively
limiting rather than compression).

#### E-6 Mono Compressor..................................

Parameter MinMax Default Description

2 0 99 20 Release time.
3 -1 36 0 Make-up gain.
4 0 99 0 Lookahead.
5 -80 12 -80 Side-chain mix.
```
This algorithm implements a mono compressor with side-chain input.

X is the audio input; A is the audio output.

Y is the side-chain input, which drives the compression amount applied to the audio signal on X.

The B output provides a CV reflecting the amount of gain reduction being applied.


The Z knob/CV sets the compression ratio, from 1 (no compression) at fully counterclockwise, to
infinity (effectively limiting rather than compression) at fully clockwise.

Parameter 0 sets the threshold level above which compression applies (in dB).

Parameters 1 & 2 set the attack and release times. The attack time range is approximately 0.1ms-1s;
the release time range is approximately 1ms-3s.

Parameter 3 sets the make-up gain (in dB). If set to -1, the make-up gain is calculated automatically
from the threshold and compression ratio.

Parameter 4 sets a lookahead time, effectively delaying the audio slightly relative to the envelope
detection. This can be used to ensure that sharp transients are not lost during the attack time of the
envelope. The maximum lookahead is about 10ms.

Parameter 5 allows the side-chain input to be mixed into the audio output. The parameter sets the
gain in multiples of 0.5dB (i.e. the maximum is +6dB and the minimum is -40dB, which is treated
as -âdB).

#### E-7 Euro to Buchla Converter......................

```
This algorithm was designed for interfacing Eurorack (or more generally, any analogue synths using
the 1V/octave standard) with Buchla synths, though it has options to cater for other, non-standard
formats.

Input X/Output A convert a pitch CV from the 1V/octave standard to the 1.2V/octave standard by
default. The exact scaling is set by parameters 1 & 2:

```
scale = 1.0 + 0.002 * ( parameter 1 ) + 0.0002 * ( parameters 2 )
```
Input Y is a gate input, triggering when the level exceeds 1V. From this, a Buchla-format combined
gate & trigger is generated from output B. This is a 4ms pulse at 10V, followed by a sustained gate
at 5V.

The Z knob/CV provides a tuning control, with a range of approximately Â±0.5 octaves.

Parameter 0 shifts the X input by whole octaves, equivalent to adding a whole number of Volts to
the X CV.

Parameter 3 applies an offset in mV to the A output.

Parameter 4 sets the gate level as (1+the parameter value)% of the 10V trigger pulse. The default


value of 49 therefore gives a 50% gate level i.e. 5V.

No video yet - we don't own a Buchla! Volunteers please get in touch.

This algorithm is for interfacing Buchla synths with Eurorack (or more generally, any analogue
synths using the 1V/octave standard).

Input X/Output A convert a pitch CV from the 1.2V/octave standard to the 1V/octave standard.

Input Y is intended to receive a Buchla-format combined trigger & gate signal (typically a 10V
trigger pulse followed by a sustained 5V gate). From this, output B generates just the trigger pulse
(at 5V). If you need the gate signal, you can directly use the Buchla output.

The Z knob/CV provides a tuning control, with a range of approximately Â±0.5 octaves.

This algorithm generates random CVs via the popular rotating shift register method. The joy of this
method is that it generates a loop of CVs, with a controllable likelihood of change, including the
possibility to lock the loop so it does not change.

X is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. On each rising edge the shift
register rotates and a new CV is output. On each rotation, there is the possibility that one bit of the
shift register will be flipped, changing the pattern. The likelihood of a flip is set by Z. When Z is
zero there is a 50% chance that the bit will flip, which is the most random setting. As Z rises, the
chance of a flip reduces, until at around 2V the chance of a flip hits zero and the pattern is
effectively locked. Conversely, as Z goes negative, the chance of a flip goes up, reaching 100% at
around -2V. This also effectively locks the pattern. When Z crosses the Â±2V boundaries, in either
direction, the display shows "**" for a short while to let you know that the pattern has been locked
or unlocked.

Input Y allows for modification of the sequence, even when the loop is locked. If input Y is above
1V, the bit will always be flipped on a clock pulse, regardless of the setting of Z.

Output A is the random pattern interpreted as a unipolar CV i.e. it is always a positive voltage.
Output B is the random pattern interpreted as a bipolar CV i.e. it can swing both positive and
negative.

Parameter 0 sets the direction of rotation. The two directions have a different sound to the patterns
they tend to generate.

Parameter 1 sets the length of the shift register, and so the length of the repeating CV pattern in
terms of clocks.

Parameter 2 sets the output slew rate. This has the same effect as the Slew Rate Limiter algorithm
being applied to the outputs.

Parameter 3 is an attenuverter for both outputs.

Parameter 4 is an offset for both outputs.

**MIDI Input:** if parameter 5 is non-zero, incoming MIDI clock advances the shift register,
according to the following table:


```

This algorithm generates random CVs via the popular rotating shift register method. The joy of this
method is that it generates a loop of CVs, with a controllable likelihood of change, including the
possibility to lock the loop so it does not change. The CVs are quantized to semitones or to a chosen
musical scale.

X is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. On each rising edge the shift
register rotates and a new CV is output. On each rotation, there is the possibility that one bit of the
shift register will be flipped, changing the pattern. The likelihood of a flip is set by Z. When Z is

Input Y allows for modification of the sequence, even when the loop is locked. If input Y is above
1V, the bit will always be flipped on a clock pulse, regardless of the setting of Z.


Output A is the random pattern of CVs, quantized to the scale chosen via parameter 2. The list of
scales is the same as that for the Quantizer algorithm, above.

Output B is a trigger output.

Parameter 0 sets the direction of rotation. The two directions have a different sound to the patterns
they tend to generate.

Parameter 1 sets the length of the shift register, and so the length of the repeating CV pattern in
terms of clocks.

Parameter 3 is an attenuverter for the random CV, applied before quantization.

Parameter 5 is a transpose amount, in semitones, applied after quantization.

Parameter 6 sets the output slew rate. This has the same effect as the Slew Rate Limiter algorithm
being applied to output A.

**MIDI Output** : each new note (i.e. when the Output B trigger fires) is output as a MIDI note
message on the MIDI channel selected in the settings.

**MIDI Input:** if parameter 7 is non-zero, incoming MIDI clock advances the shift register,
according to the table above.

The MIDI Gate parameter works in the same way as for the Quantizer, above.

set in that output's shift register.

Parameters 0 & 1 set the length of the shift registers, and so the length of the repeating trigger
patterns in terms of clocks.

Parameters 2 & 3 set the length of the output pulses. At zero, the pulse is a fixed length of 10ms.
Values of 1-31 set the pulse length to a fraction of the clock time.

This algorithm provides a software implementation of the Expert Sleepers ES-2 module. The in
conjunction with the Silent Way CV Input plug-in this allows you to pass CVs from your modular
into your DAW via a regular audio interface.

X & Y are the two inputs - connect these to CV outputs from your modular.

A & B are the corresponding outputs - connect these to inputs on your audio interface.

Z provides a trim control, allowing adjustment of the ES-2's operating frequency. Start with this at
zero (LEDs off) and adjust to minimise noise in the CV recovered from the plug-in.


#### G-3 Pitch Reference......................................

ParameterMin MaxDefault Description

1 -1 9 4 Octave.
```
Generates sine and square waves at a fixed pitch, specified by the parameters.

Z sets the amplitude of the outputs.

When the pitch is changed, the note name is scrolled across the display, first as a normal name (e.g.
'C#4') and then as a MIDI note number (e.g. 61).

#### G-4 Frequency Reference.............................

```
Video
X & Y are not used
A is sine output
B is square output
Z sets the amplitude of A & B
```
Generates sine and square waves at a fixed frequency, specified in Hz.

Z sets the amplitude of the outputs.

When the pitch is changed, the frequency is scrolled across the display (e.g. '440Hz').

This algorithm uses an interface unlike any other, in order to be able to set the digits of the
frequency individually. It is somewhat like the usual parameters interface, in that pressing Z
advances through the digits, and turning S changes the values.

When S is turned, a pair of digits is displayed. The first is the decimal place that is being edited in
the frequency value e.g. '0' is ones, '1' is tens, '2' is hundreds and so on. The second digit is the value
of that digit within the frequency value.

Pressing Z advances the decimal place, and displays a pair of digits as above representing that new
part of the frequency value, which can then be edited with S.


#### G-5 Tuner.....................................................

```
Video
X is input
Y is not used
A is a copy of X
B is a sine wave at the tracked pitch
Z sets the amplitude of B
```
This algorithm provides a chromatic tuner. The pitch of the input signal is tracked and displayed as
a note name, with indication of whether the note is sharp or flat.

Natural notes are shown in capitals i.e. 'C', 'D', 'E' etc. Lower case letters indicate sharps e.g. 'c'
indicates C sharp, 'd', indicates D sharp.

Following the note name a '-' indicates that the note is below the true pitch (flat) and '+' indicates
that the note is above the true pitch (sharp). If the note is within 1 cent of the true pitch, neither '-'
nor '+' is shown.

Output A is a copy of X, so the tuner can be left inline without needing a mult.

Output B is a sine wave at the pitch of the detected note. The amplitude of the sine wave is set by
the Z knob/CV.

#### G-6 Clock.....................................................

```
This algorithm converts clocks between MIDI clocks, analogue clocks and an internal timebase, in
any combination. The mode of operation is determined by parameter 0.


```
Value A/B driven by MIDI driven by Typical application
0 MIDI X Legacy disting behaviour.
1 X X Another module is the clock leader; disting converts to
MIDI clock and generates clock divisions.
2 Internal X
3 MIDI Internal Disting converts MIDI clock to analogue clock.
4 X Internal
5 Internal Internal Disting is the clock leader, generating analogue clock
and MIDI clock.
```
The internal clock is started & stopped by pushing the Z knob. There are two choices, set by
parameter 6: a tempo-based clock or a tap tempo clock.

```
Value Mode Description
0 Start/Stop Push Z to start the internal clock; push it again to stop the clock.
Parameter 5 sets the tempo, as 120 plus the parameter value (i.e. the
range is 0-240 bpm).
1 Tap Tempo Push Z five times to start the clock (i.e. a one bar count-in in 4 time).
Hold Z for 2 seconds to stop the clock. While the clock is running, you
may continue to tap Z to correct or change the tempo.
Parameter 5 offsets the tempo set by tapping (up or down in BPM steps).
```
While the internal clock is running, the top left pixel of the display flashes in time.

Whatever the clock source, outputs A & B generate 5V clock pulses according to parameters 1 & 2.
The parameter/divisor relationship is as per the following table:

```
Parameter valueOutput A/BParameter valueOutput A/B
-2 Run/stop
-1 Reset pulse
0 1/96 8 1/4
1 1/48 9 1/3
2 1/32 10 1/2
3 1/24 11 1/1
4 1/16 12 2/1
5 1/12 13 3/1
6 1/8 14 4/1
7 1/6
```

In modes that use it, input X is a clock input, with a threshold of 1V. Parameter 3 sets the
interpretation of X according to the following table:

```
Parameter valueInput XParameter valueInput X
0 1/96 6 1/8
1 1/48 7 1/6
2 1/32 8 1/4
3 1/24 9 1/3
4 1/16 10 1/2
5 1/12 11 1/1
```
Parameter 4 controls whether input Y is used as a run/stop input:

```
Value Y mode Description
0 Not used. The X clock is taken to start as soon as pulses appear on the X
input, and is assumed to have stopped if no pulses appear for two
seconds.
1 Run/stop for X. The X clock is ignored until Y goes high (over 1V) and stops when
Y goes low.
2 Run/stop for internal. The internal clock starts when Y goes high and stops when Y goes
low.
3 Run/stop for both. Both the X clock and the internal clock are controlled by Y as
above.
```
Parameter 7 enables "ratcheting" - a CV controllable clock multiplier. This can be enabled for
outputs A, B, or both, and can multiply by powers of 2 only (1, 2, 4, 8, 16), or by multiples of 2 and
3 (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16).

```
Parameter value Ratchet mode A Ratchet mode B
0 Off Off
1 2's Off
2 Off 2's
3 2's 2's
4 2's/3's Off
5 Off 2's/3's
6 2's/3's 2's/3's
```
When enabled, the Z input/pot controls the multiplier. When Z is at 0V, the clock output is
suppressed; higher voltages give higher multipliers. If you prefer a 0V CV input to correspond to 1x
multiplier instead of stopping the clock, simply turn Z slightly clockwise to bias the input positive.


#### G-7 MIDI/CV...............................................

5 0 2 0 Priority.
6 0 1 0 Mode.
```
Performs a MIDI to CV conversion on MIDI notes arriving on the disting's MIDI port.

The received MIDI channel is selected in the settings.

Parameter 6 sets the mode of operation.

In mode 0: Output A is the pitch CV output; output B is the gate output.

In mode 1: Output A is the pitch CV output; output B is another pitch CV output using the next
MIDI channel up.

Outputs A & B can also be controlled directly via MIDI CCs 33 & 34 respectively (the CC range of
0-127 is mapped to -5V to +5V), or via MIDI CCs 35 & 36 (the CC range of 0-127 is mapped to 0V
to 10V).

Parameter 2 selects a scale to use, if any are provided on the SD card. See âScala Supportâ above.
The default value of -1 disables this function.

Parameter 3 enables a 'fingered portamento' effect, that is, a glide from one note to the next if they
are played legato. Higher parameter values give a slower glide.

Parameter 4 enables an interruption of the gate output when notes are played legato. The parameter
value sets the time in milliseconds to send the gate low when a new note is played.

Parameter 5 sets the note priority mode. The options are Last, Low, and High.


#### G-8 CV/MIDI...............................................

```

X is pitch CV input
Y is gate input
A & B pass through X & Y
Z is mod wheel or velocity CV input

0 0 99 16 Channel offset.
1 0 127 0 Z mode.
2 0 99 0 X CC.
3 0 99 0 Y CC.
```
Generates MIDI notes (on the MIDI channel selected in the settings) from the pitch and gate CVs
on the X & Y inputs.

Parameter 0 sets an offset between the timing of the X & Y inputs (in sample frames). It is generally
a good idea to delay the pitch slightly relative to the gate, to ensure that the pitch has changed and
settled before the gate triggers a new note.

Parameter 1 chooses the function of the Z knob/CV. If 0, Z sets the velocity of the generated MIDI
notes. Otherwise, Z generates CC messages using the parameter value as the CC number, and the
note velocity is fixed at 64.

Parameters 2 & 3, when non-zero, allow you to generate CC messages from the X & Y inputs
(using the parameter value as the CC number). If Y is to be converted to a CC, then notes are no
longer generated.

#### H-1 Crossfade/Pan........................................

```
Video
A = Mix of X & Y according to Z
B = Inverted mix of X & Y according to Z, or LFO
Knob recorder enabled
Parameter MinMax Default Description
0 0 3 0 Crossfade/pan law.
1 0 2 0 Clip mode.
2 -1 99 0 Output B option/LFO speed.
3 0 32 32 Output B attenuation.
```
Viewed as a stereo output, A & B provide a panned version of X, plus an oppositely panned version
of Y.

Viewed as mono outputs, A provides a crossfaded mix of X & Y, while B provides a mix with an
inverted mix control.

In both cases Z provides the pan position or crossfade amount. When Z is turned, the crossfade
position is displayed as a percentage (so 50% is an equal mix of the two sources/centre pan).


Parameter 0 sets the pan/crossfade law:

```
0 Equal gain Appropriate for crossfading phase-coherent material.
1 Equal power Appropriate for crossfading non-phase-coherent material.
2 Transition DJ-style crossfade where both sources are at full gain at the 50% position.
3 FX Loop Output A is unattenuated input X plus a faded amount of input Y.
```
Parameter 1 sets the clipping/saturation mode, for when the mix of the inputs exceeds the dynamic
range of the output:

```
0 Legacy
The behaviour pre-firmware 4.8, which could cause digital overflows and
fairly drastic wavefolding-type sounds.
1 Hard clip A hard digital clip is applied.
2 Soft clip A soft clip/saturation is applied.
```
Parameter 2 controls the function of output B:

```
-1 Copy Output B follows input X.
0 Normal Normal crossfade/pan function.
```
```
1-99 LFO
Output B is a Â±5V triangle wave LFO, the speed of which is set from the
parameter.
```
Parameter 3 attenuates output B (in all modes).

##### FX Loop usage.........................................

A combination of parameters 0 and 2 can be used to set up the disting as an effect loop controller, to
integrate external effect units (e.g. pedals, rack processors) into the modular.

Use input X as the main signal input. Setting parameter 2 to -1 makes output B a copy of the input,
attenuated by parameter 3, which can be sent to the effects unit.

Return the effected signal to input Y. There are then two options for how you want to mix in the
effect. With parameter 0 at 0, 1, or 2, the Z knob/CV gives you a wet/dry mix control. With
parameter 0 at 3, the amount of input X in the mix is constant, so Z gives you a simple fader on the
effect return.


#### H-2 Dual Sample and Hold..........................

3 0 64 0 Noise Y.
4 0 32 0 Slew A.
5 0 32 0 Slew B.
```
**If parameter 0 is 0 (the default)** :
Output A is a sample of input X, taken when the trigger input Z goes over 1V. (Sample and Hold)
**If parameter 0 is 1** :
Output A follows input X while input Z is over 1V. When Z falls below 0.5V, output A is held until
Z goes over 1V again. (Track and Hold)

Similarly for output B/input Y.

Pressing the Z knob triggers a sample manually.

Parameter 1 sets an offset between the timing of the X/Y & Z inputs (in sample frames). If X/Y & Z
are being driven together, for example by a sequencer's pitch and gate, it is often a good idea to
delay the trigger slightly to allow time for the sampled CV to settle before the sample is taken.

Parameters 2 & 3 add white noise into the signal from inputs X & Y respectively, allowing you to
use the algorithm as a source of random voltages without having to patch anything into the inputs.

Parameters 4 & 5 control the amount of slew applied to outputs A & B respectively.

#### H-3 Dual Quantizer (Z scale).......................

```
Video
A = quantized( X )
B = quantized( Y )
Z chooses scale
Outputs MIDI
Parameter MinMax Default Description
0 0 32 32 Input X attenuation.
1 0 32 32 Input Y attenuation.
2 -31 31 0 X transpose.
3 -31 31 0 Y transpose.
```
Output A is a quantized version of input X; the closest whole-semitone value to the unquantized
V/octave pitch CV X. Similarly output B is a quantized version of input Y.

As well as providing a chromatic scale, this algorithm can also constrain the quantized values to a
musical scale or chord. This is controlled by the Z knob/CV.


When Z changes, the scale is displayed on the LEDs. The scale's number in the following table is
shown, and after a short pause, the scale's name.

```
Number Scale Displayed name
0 chromatic Chromatic
1 major scale Major
2 minor scale Minor
3 major triad Triad
4 minor triad 3b+5
5 root+5th Fifth
6 major triad+6th Triad+6

11 root+5th+7th 5+7
12 pentatonic major Pent
13 pentatonic minor Minor Pent
14 natural minor scale Nat Minor
15 harmonic minor scale Harm Minor
```
For each quantizer, a parameter provides a transpose control. The transposition is applied to the
input before it is forced into the chosen scale i.e. the transposition moves the notes around within
the same key.

The quantized notes names are shown on the display (A left, B right). Natural notes are shown in
capitals i.e. 'C', 'D', 'E' etc. Lower case letters indicate sharps e.g. 'c' indicates C sharp, 'd', indicates
D sharp.

**MIDI Output** : each new note is output as a MIDI note message on the MIDI channel selected in
the settings (input X/output A) or on the next highest channel (input Y/output B). E.g. if the settings
specify MIDI channel 4, the notes are output on channels 4 (X/A) and 5 (Y/B).

```
Output A is a quantized version of input X; the closest whole-semitone value to the unquantized
V/octave pitch CV X. Similarly output B is a quantized version of input Y.

As well as providing a chromatic scale, this algorithm can also constrain the quantized values to a
musical scale or chord. This is controlled by parameters 2 & 3.

Â±13 pentatonic major

Â±15 natural minor

Â±18 MIDI 2
```
Additionally, the parameter being positive or negative controls whether the quantizer works in
triggered mode or not. The triggers are provided by input Z (approximately 1V is required to trigger
it). If the parameter is negative, the quantizer is triggered - the input is only sampled and converted
to a new quantized value when triggered by input Z. If the parameter is positive, the input is
constantly sampled and a new note is output as soon as the input moves into the next semitone
range.


If the scale selected is 'MIDI 1' or 'MIDI 2' (values 17 & 18) the candidate notes for quantization are
set via MIDI. The algorithm listens for MIDI note on messages and uses the received notes for the
quantization pattern. While any notes are held, playing new notes adds to the pattern. When all
notes are released and a new note played, the pattern is reset and formed from the new note.

In 'MIDI 1' mode the played MIDI notes set the note names, but quantization can happen in any
octave (i.e. if you play a 'D' the output will always be 'D' but the octave will depend on the octave of
the incoming CV).

In 'MIDI 2' mode the played MIDI notes are the only ones that can be output (so say if you play
middle C and the D above, the output will always be one of those two notes, depending on whether
the input CV is below or above middle C).

The quantized notes names are shown on the display (A left, B right). Natural notes are shown in
capitals i.e. 'C', 'D', 'E' etc. Lower case letters indicate sharps e.g. 'c' indicates C sharp, 'd', indicates
D sharp.

**MIDI Output** : each new note is output as a MIDI note message on the MIDI channel selected in
the settings (input X/output A) or on the next highest channel (input Y/output B). E.g. if the settings
specify MIDI channel 4, the notes are output on channels 4 (X/A) and 5 (Y/B).

The MIDI Gate parameter works in the same way as for the Quantizer, above.

## H-5 Dual Euclidean Patterns........................

```
Video
A is pattern 1 out
B is pattern 2 out
X is clock input
Y is reset input
Z sets the 'pulses' for pattern 2

Parameter MinMax Default Description
0 1 16 16 Steps.
1 1 16 4 Pulses (pattern 1).
2 0 96 0 A Rotation.
3 0 31 0 Pulse length.
4 -1 96 -1 B Rotation.
5 0 96 0 Repeat.
6 -15 15 0 MIDI clock divisor.
```
This algorithm generates rhythmic patterns of output pulses known as Euclidean patterns. For a
detailed description of these patterns and how they are commonly found in music around the world
see e.g. here^9 or here^10.

A pattern is described by the total number of steps (controlled by parameter 0) and the number of
pulses (i.e. the number steps on which a pulse is output) (controlled by parameter 1 for output A and
by Z for output B).

Parameter 2 sets a 'rotation' of the pattern. At zero rotation, the first step in the pattern will always

9 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_rhythm
10 [http://www.hisschemoller.com/blog/2011/euclidean-rhythms/](http://www.hisschemoller.com/blog/2011/euclidean-rhythms/)


be a pulse, and the remaining pulses distributed according to the algorithm. The rotation setting
moves the first pulse by a number of steps i.e. moves the down beat.

The two patterns can use the same rotation value, or independent values. If parameter 4 is -1,
pattern 2 shares the rotation value set by parameter 2. Otherwise, it uses the rotation set by
parameter 4.

Parameter 3 sets the length of the output pulse. At zero, the pulse is a fixed length of 10ms. Values
of 1-31 set the pulse length to a fraction of the clock time.

Parameter 5 sets the overall repeat count i.e. the number of clocks until the pattern repeats. If this is
zero, the number of steps (parameter 0) is used as the repeat. If the repeat count is greater than the
number of steps, the pattern is extended with silence.

Input X is the clock input, advancing the pattern by one step each time the input exceeds 1V. Input
Y is a reset input, resetting the pattern to step 1.

**MIDI Input:** if parameter 6 is non-zero, the patterns are controlled by incoming MIDI clock. If the
parameter is positive, the patterns simply advance according to the clock divisor table above. If the
parameter is negative, the patterns are also locked in to the MIDI transport: the pattern position
depends absolutely on the number of clocks since the last MIDI start message (and so is predictable
and repeatable).

## H-6 Dual Delayed Pulse Generator..............

```
Video
A is pulse triggered by X
B is pulse triggered by Y

ParameterMin MaxDefault Description
0 0 6 0 Z mode.
1 0 12 6 Range.
2 -1 31 -1 Delay.
3 0 31 7 Length.
```
Outputs A & B are pulse generators (0-5V) triggered by inputs X & Y respectively (1V required to
trigger). The delay between the trigger and the output pulse, and the length of the pulse, can both be
controlled.

Unless in a mode where they are set by the Z input/CV, the delay and length are set from
parameters 2 & 3. Parameter 1 provides a range control, which scales both the delay and length
times. When the range parameter is 0, the maximum time is 10ms. Higher settings for range
progressively double the maximum time; at the maximum ranage setting of 12, the maximum time
is therefore 40.96s.

Parameter 0 controls the function of Z:

```
Parameter 0 value Z function
0 Z controls delay
1 Z controls length
2 Output override (high). Z over 1V forces both outputs high.
3 Output override (low). Z over 1V forces both outputs low.
```

```
4 Input enable. Z below 1V disables input triggers.
5 Input disable. Z above 1V disables input triggers.
6 Z is an additional trigger input which triggers both outputs.
```
## H-7 Noise......................................................

2 -1 31 31 Attenuation A.
3 -1 31 31 Attenuation B.
```
Dual output variable-colour noise generator, with two optional VCAs.

Outputs A and B are noise, with colour according to the parameter values:

```
Parameter value Noise colour
-1 Blended
0 Violet
1 White
2 Pink
3 Red
```
If 'blended' is chosen, the noise colour can be smoothly swept from violet to red with the Z
knob/CV.

Parameters 2 & 3 set the attenuation of the outputs (31 corresponds to Â±8V output for white noise).
If the parameter is set to -1, the corresponding X/Y input is used to set the output amplitude
(equivalent to following the noise output with a VCA driven by X/Y). The X/Y inputs are clamped
at 0V i.e. negative input voltages yield silence.

```
The imaginatively-named Quantizer 2 algorithm offers pitch quantization to musical scales, with
real-time user control over the notes in the scale to quantize to, and with two CV outputs that can be
offset by a musical interval (e.g. a third, a fifth, an octave etc.).

X is the pitch CV input. Parameter 3 allows you to attenuate the signal before it is quantized.

Y is either a second pitch CV input, simply added to X, or a trigger input. When it is a pitch input, it
is added to X after X has been attenuated â the attenuation parameter does not affect Y.

Parameter 4 controls the function of Y. When the parameter is in the range -32 to 0, Y is a CV
input, attenuated by the parameter (so -32 means no attenuation, -16 means 50%, and 0 means
complete attenuation). When the parameter is 1-32 Y is a trigger input, and the parameter defines an
offset (in sample frames) between the timing of the X & Y inputs. It is often a good idea to delay
the trigger slightly relative to the pitch, to ensure that the pitch has changed and settled before the
trigger samples a new note.

A & B are the quantized pitch CV outputs. The Z knob/CV controls an interval between the two
CVs, applied to output B. The interval is specified in scale degrees, so for example '3' is a third, and
'8' is an octave. 'U' is displayed for unison. Note that this is not simply a constant voltage offset
between the outputs â the voltage difference changes according to the position in the scale. For
example, if the interval is a third, in C major, and output A is C (0V), then output B will be E
(0.333V, a difference of 0.333V); if output A is D (0.167V), output B will be F (0.417V, a
difference of 0.25V).

Parameter 5 sets a slew rate for both outputs. At a value of 0 there is no slew; larger values apply
increasingly more slew.

Parameter 1 chooses the scale. The available options are:

```
Value Name Notes Example (on C)
0 Major 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 C D E F G A B
1 Natural Minor 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11 C D Eâ­ F G Aâ­ Bâ­
2 Harmonic Minor 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12 C D Eâ­ F G Aâ­ B
```

Parameter 2 sets the key to quantize into. The displayed key names assume that 0V pitch CV
corresponds to the note C. The parameter value does not represent semitones, but degrees around
the circle of fifths. Equivalently, the parameter indicates the number of sharps or flats:

```
Parameter value Key Parameter value Key
-5 Dâ­ 0 C
```
```
-4 Aâ­ 1 G
-3 Eâ­ 2 D
```
```
-2 Bâ­ 3 A
```
```
-1 F 4 E
5 B
6 Fâ¯
```
Parameter 0 defines the quantizer pattern â the selection of notes from the scale that are available
for the CV to adopt. The user interface to editing the pattern is unique to this algorithm. When
parameter 0 is the current parameter, turning the S knob scrolls through the degrees of the scale e.g.
from 1 to 7 for a major scale. (The actual notes that these scale degrees refer to depend on the
selected key and scale.) Next to the number of the scale degree is either a '+', which indicates the
degree is included in the quantizer pattern, or '.', which indicates that it is not. Pressing the S knob
toggles between these two states.

When the display is not showing a parameter value or name, it shows the note name of the pitch CV
on output A (assuming, as mentioned above, that 0V corresponds to a C).

**MIDI Input** : MIDI note messages received on MIDI channel 1 or 2 set the quantizer pattern. The
notes of the C major scale (i.e. the white keys) turn on & off the corresponding degrees of the
pattern. Note that C major is always used for the MIDI input, regardless of which key the quantizer
is actually working in. The octave of the MIDI notes makes no difference. How the notes control
the pattern depends on the MIDI channel:

- MIDI channel 1: A note on message toggles the state of the degree in the pattern on or off.
- MIDI channel 2: The pattern is set from the notes currently being held down.

This algorithm continuously plays audio files, in a manner very much inspired by Tom Whitwell's
Radio Music module.


The current audio file is selected with the Z knob/CV. It plays, forever, at its natural speed (see the
algorithms below if you want to control the speed), looping when it gets to the end; or it plays until
the end of the file and stops, depending on the 'loop' setting.

X is a retrigger input. A trigger pulse in excess of 1V will reset the playback position. The initial
playback position is set by the Y input. The voltage range 0-8V corresponds to the length of the file
so e.g. 0V input (or no input) sets the initial position to the start of the file, 4V input sets the initial
position to halfway through the file, etc.

When switching between files, the playback position is maintained, modulo the length of the new
file. For example, if you're 5 seconds into a 10 second file:

- if you switch to a 20 second file, the position will be 5 seconds into the new file.
- if you switch to a 2 second file, the position will be 1 second into the new file.

(Though see the 'useStartOnSampleChange' playlist option above to override this behaviour.)

A & B are the left & right audio outputs respectively.

Parameter 0 chooses the sample folder. These are sorted alphabetically, or in the order specified in
the playlist, if one is provided.

Parameter 1 sets the trigger mode and envelope time. If the parameter is 0, the trigger input is
simply that â only a positive-going edge is used, to retrigger the sample. If the parameter is 1 or
more, then the trigger input is treated like a gate: a positive-going edge retriggers the sample, but
also when the trigger CV goes low, the sample playback stops. The value of the parameter specifies
the length of a decay envelope that is applied to the sample, so it can stop suddenly or gradually
fade out.

**MIDI Input** : MIDI note on & off messages are handled equivalently to a trigger or gate on the X
input â that is, a note on retriggers the sample, and if the envelope time is non-zero, a note off will
stop the playback.

This algorithm plays audio files, the speed of which is set by incoming clock pulses.

The current audio file is selected with the Z knob/CV, if parameter 2 is -1, or by the parameter
itself, if it is in the range 0-99.

X is a retrigger input. A trigger pulse in excess of 1V will reset the playback position to the start of
the sample, if Z is being used to select the sample, or to the position set by Z (the full range of Z,
approximately -5V to 5V, corresponds to the length of the sample).


Y is the clock input. The speed of the sample playback is adjusted so that the whole sample fits into
the time taken for a number of clocks, where that number is set (per sample) in the playlist.

When switching between files, the playback position is maintained, as for the I-1Audio Playback
algorithm.

A & B are the left & right audio outputs respectively.

Parameters 0 & 1 are the standard sample folder and envelope time parameters, described above.

**MIDI Input** : MIDI note on & off messages are handled equivalently to a trigger or gate on the X

2 0 99 0 Envelope time.
3 -1 4 -1 MIDI mode.
4 0 24 2 Pitch bend depth.
```
This algorithm is much the same as 'I-1 Audio Playback', except that it forgoes the sample start
position input and instead has a pitch input.

Y is the pitch input, using the 1V/octave standard. 0V corresponds to the sample playing at its
natural pitch. Positive voltages speed up playback; negative voltages slow it down.

Parameter 1 shifts the pitch up or down in octave increments.

Note that there is a limit to how fast data can be streamed from the SD card. If you speed playback
up by a large factor, you may get dropouts.

Parameters 0 & 2 are the standard sample folder and envelope time parameters, described above.

**MIDI Input** : MIDI note on & off messages are handled equivalently to a trigger or gate on the X
input â that is, a note on retriggers the sample, and if the envelope time is non-zero, a note off will
stop the playback. Additionally, the pitch of the note on message is used instead of the Y input CV,
so you can effectively play the disting like a sampler from a MIDI keyboard. MIDI note 48 (C3)
corresponds to a 0V input i.e. playing the sample at its natural pitch. MIDI pitch bend is supported;
parameter 4 sets the bend depth in semitones.

Parameter 3 'MIDI mode' allows for polyphonic operation, using multiple disting mk4 modules. If
the parameter is -1 or 0, the module responds to MIDI like a monophonic synthesizer^11. Otherwise,
the parameter is a 'voice ID' in a polyphonic setup. By giving different voice IDs to multiple

11 It is the intention that in future MIDI modes -1 and 0 might differ, for example in reusing the CV inputs that are
likely not used if you're controlling the module via MIDI, but currently they are the same.


distings, and feeding them the same MIDI, you can create a polyphonic sample player where each
disting takes a different note of a held chord.

(Recall that the Select Bus provides a convenient way to send the same MIDI to multiple distings
without extra cabling - see above.)

By default the polyphonic operation uses a 'lowest voice' allocation scheme â each new note is
allocated to the voice with the lowest ID that is not currently playing a note. It is also possible to
select a 'round robin' allocation scheme, which often works better with samples with a decay tail.
This is done by sending MIDI CC #21 with a value of the number of polyphonic voices available.
Sending this CC also resets the round robin to voice 1 (you may like to do this at the start of a song
playback, for example, to ensure consistent results on each play). Sending CC #21 with value 0
reverts to lowest voice allocation.

This algorithm is much the same as the 'I-1 Audio Playback' algorithm, except that it forgoes
voltage control of the current sample and instead offers a speed control.

Z is the linear speed control. The central position corresponds to the sample playing at its natural
pitch. Positive voltages speed up playback; negative voltages slow it down. Because the scale is
linear it is possible to slow it down all the way to being stopped.

The current sample is selected via parameter 1.

Parameters 0 & 2 are the standard sample folder and envelope time parameters, described above.

**MIDI Input** : MIDI note on & off messages are handled equivalently to a trigger or gate on the X
input â that is, a note on retriggers the sample, and if the envelope time is non-zero, a note off will
stop the playback.

```
Similar to âI-4 Audio Playback with Z Speedâ except that the playback speed is allowed to go
negative i.e. the sample can play backwards. Playback speed is linear with Z, with a maximum of
around 2x speed, and with 0V/center Z corresponding to a speed of zero.

Input Y selects the sample. Parameter 1 is added to input Y, so you can effectively use either or a
combination of both to select the sample. Note that in this algorithm a maximum of 50 samples are
accessible, not the usual 100.

The algorithm caches a reversed copy of each sample to the MicroSD card. It does this once only
for each sample, when it finds a new sample or one that has changed. This may take a few seconds,
during which time the message âProcessing...â scrolls across the display. Do not remove the
MicroSD card or turn off the disting during this time, in case the MicroSD card becomes corrupted.

Parameters 0 & 2 are the standard sample folder and envelope time parameters, described above.

**MIDI Input** : MIDI note on & off messages are handled equivalently to a trigger or gate on the X
input â that is, a note on retriggers the sample, and if the envelope time is non-zero, a note off will

In this algorithm the sample playback position is directly driven from the Y input. Imagine a piece
of audio tape passing over a tape head â in other algorithms, that tape is constantly moving at some
speed or other as if driven by a motor, but in this algorithm you're basically dragging the tape back
and forwards over the playhead yourself.


Parameter 1 sets a limit on the speed at which the audio can play. With long samples or rapidly
changing Y inputs it is easy to demand very high playback speeds, and this parameter enables you
to put a cap on that.

Parameter 2 sets a slew limit, effectively putting a low-pass filter on the Y input. This is useful
particularly when using a manually-generated CV to remove any âtwitchinessâ.

Parameter 3 sets an offset on the Y input, essentially adding or subtracting a constant voltage.

The algorithm caches a reversed copy of each sample to the MicroSD card. It does this once only
for each sample, when it finds a new sample or one that has changed. This may take a few seconds,
during which time the message âProcessing...â scrolls across the display. Do not remove the
MicroSD card or turn off the disting during this time, in case the MicroSD card becomes corrupted.

Parameter 0 is the standard sample folder parameter, described above.

This algorithm simultaneously plays two audio files, each with its own trigger input. It was
developed particularly with drum triggering in mind, but all the usual playback options are
supported. For drum applications, the preferred playlist options are:

```
-loop=0
-gap=0
-fadeIn=0
-fadeOut=0
-retriggerOnSampleChange=0
```
The Z knob/input selects the samples, in pairs â the sample triggered by the X input is always an
even-numbered sample, and the Y input triggers the next sample up.

Parameter 1 selects between two options for how the outputs are used:

- If the parameter is 0, then the sample triggered by X plays out of output A, and the sample
  triggered by Y plays out of output B. Stereo samples are summed to mono.
- If the parameter is 1, then mono samples are panned centrally, and stereo samples are played
  in stereo.

Parameters 0 & 2 are the standard sample folder and envelope time parameters, described above.

The triggers are 'velocity sensitive' â the volume of the sample depends on the voltage of the trigger
pulse.

**MIDI Input** : MIDI note on & off messages are handled equivalently to a trigger or gate on the X &
Y inputs â that is, a note on retriggers the sample, and if the envelope time is non-zero, a note off


will stop the playback. MIDI note 48 (C3) triggers sample A; note 49 triggers sample B.

The two samples are selected by parameters 1 & 2.

Parameter 3 selects the panning option â refer to the description in the algorithm above.

Parameter 4 selects which samples are affected by the speed control, as follows:

```
Parameter value Description

1 Sample A speed fixed; B variable.
2 Sample B speed fixed; A variable.

Parameters 0 & 5 are the standard sample folder and envelope time parameters, described above.

The triggers are 'velocity sensitive' â the volume of the sample depends on the voltage of the trigger

**MIDI Input** : MIDI note on & off messages are handled equivalently to a trigger or gate on the X &

Algorithm-specific playlist filename: midi-playlist-clocked.txt

This algorithm plays MIDI files, converting the MIDI into CV outputs on A & B (as detailed
above).

The current MIDI file is selected with the Z knob/CV, if parameter 0 is -1, or by the parameter itself
if it is in the range 0-31, in which case Z is not used.

The X input is a clock, which controls the speed of the MIDI file playback. A clock pulse should
exceed 1V. The clocks correspond to quarter notes in the MIDI file.

Y is a retrigger input. A trigger pulse in excess of 1V will reset the file to the beginning.

**MIDI Output** : the MIDI file being played is transmitted unaltered on the disting's MIDI output.

## J-2 Multisample 2 Audio Playback..............

5 0 1 1 Selects the panning option.
6 0 60 0 Gate offset.
```
This algorithm plays audio files, using a 1V/octave pitch input (Y) to both select the sample and
control its pitch. This would typically be used for playing a multisampled instrument across a range
of pitches, or for mapping individual sounds (e.g. drums) to different notes.

This is a dual version of the Multisample Audio Playback algorithm below. Two voices play at
once; they can play continuously, but a more typical use would be to use the envelope time
parameter to have notes decay when the gate closes â then, this being a dual algorithm, one note can


continue to decay while the next one starts.

The other main difference between this and the monophonic Multisample Audio Playback
algorithm is in the behaviour of the pitch CV input. In the monophonic algorithm the pitch CV is
used to choose the sample when triggered, but also continues to be 'live' during the playback,
allowing bends, vibrato etc. In this dual algorithm, the pitch CV is sampled when the playback is
triggered; subsequent CV change has no effect until it moves by more than a semitone, in which
case a new note is triggered.

X is a retrigger input. A trigger pulse in excess of 1V will reset the playback position to the start of
the sample. The trigger is 'velocity sensitive' â the volume of the sample depends on the voltage of
the trigger pulse.

The Z knob/CV provides a tuning control, with a range of approximately Â±0.5 octaves. Note that
this is applied after the sample has been selected using the Y CV; changing Z will not affect the
sample selection.

A & B are the left & right audio outputs respectively.

Parameter 1 shifts the pitch up or down in octave increments. It is equivalent to offsetting the pitch
CV input â it also affects the sample selection.

Parameters 0 & 2 are the standard sample folder and envelope time parameters, described above.

Parameter 6 offsets (delays) the retrigger/gate input relative to the pitch input. This is useful to
allow pitch CVs to settle before they are sampled on the rising gate, and also to cope with modules
which output both a pitch and gate but change their pitch first. In both cases, an offset allows the
algorithm to choose the correct sample, rather than choosing the wrong sample and then re-pitching
it to match the CV.

**MIDI Input** : MIDI note on & off messages are handled equivalently to a trigger or gate on the X
input â that is, a note on retriggers the sample, and if the envelope time is non-zero, a note off will
stop the playback. Additionally, the pitch of the note on message is used instead of the Y input CV,
so you can effectively play the disting like a sampler from a MIDI keyboard. MIDI note 48 (C3)
corresponds to a 0V input. MIDI pitch bend is supported; parameter 4 sets the bend depth in
semitones.

Parameter 3 'MIDI mode' works in the same way as for algorithm I-3 â see above.

Parameter 5 sets the sample panning as in the Dual Audio Playback algorithm above. This
algorithm defaults the setting to 1 so that the two voices are summed, but setting it to zero can give
you some nice stereo effects where alternate notes are panned oppositely.

Please see below for information regarding Multisample playlists.

Algorithm-specific playlist filename: midi-playlist-free.txt

This algorithm plays MIDI files, converting the MIDI into CV outputs on A & B (as detailed
above).

The current MIDI file is selected via the parameter i.e. by turning the S knob.

The playback speed is set by a combination of the Z knob/CV and the X CV. With both at zero, the
MIDI file plays at 120bpm. Z offers a linear speed control - positive voltages speed up playback;
negative voltages slow it down. Because the scale is linear it is possible to slow it down all the way
to being stopped. X offers an exponential (1V/octave) speed control - the speed doubles for every
1V above zero, and halves for every 1V below zero.

Y is a retrigger input. A trigger pulse in excess of 1V will reset the file to the beginning.

**MIDI Output** : the MIDI file being played is transmitted unaltered on the disting's MIDI output.

```
This algorithm is much the same as the base I-1 Audio Playback algorithm, except that it forgoes
voltage control of the current sample and instead offers control over the sample end point.

X and Z are the retrigger and end position controls.

- If Z is negative, X is the retrigger input, and Z controls the sample end point. So, if you
  require manual control over the end point, turn the Z knob counterclockwise to shorten the
  sample.
- If Z is positive, Z is the retrigger input, and X controls the sample end point. In this case X
  is scaled in the same way as input Y, so varying Y and feeding X the same CV plus a small
  offset will give you a short segment of the sample that moves around with the input. The
  trigger fed into Z should be a positive pulse over about 1V.

When Z is adjusted through the switching point between these two modes, the display will show
"Xt" or "Zt" (for X trigger or Z trigger) for a short while.

The current sample is selected via parameter 1.

Parameters 0 & 2 are the standard sample folder and envelope time parameters, described above.

**MIDI Input** : MIDI note on & off messages are handled equivalently to a trigger or gate on the X
input â that is, a note on retriggers the sample, and if the envelope time is non-zero, a note off will
stop the playback.


## J-5 Audio Recorder.......................................

```
Video
X is left audio input
Y is right audio input
Z controls recording
A is left audio output
B is right audio output
```
This algorithm records the incoming audio to a WAV file on the MicroSD card.

X & Y are the audio inputs. The incoming audio is echoed directly to the A & B outputs.

The Z knob/CV controls recording. When Z exceeds approximately 1V, recording starts. When it
falls below 0.5V, recording stops. If Z already exceeds 1V when the algorithm is started, it must fall
below 0.5V before recording can be started for the first time.

```
Do not remove the MicroSD card or power off the disting while recording is active,
as this could corrupt the card.
```
The recorded WAV files are stereo, 16 bit, 46.875kHz. The files are named sequentially starting
with REC00000.WAV (then REC00001.WAV, REC00002.WAV etc.). If there are already
recordings on the card, the next available filename will be used; the old files will not be
overwritten.

The files are placed in a folder named '!RECORD'^12. If this folder does not exist, it will be created.

When recording is complete, a small text file will also be written to the card, with the same
filename but with the extension '.TXT'. This will detail any dropouts that occurred while recording
the file (or ideally simply 'No dropouts').

The disting's screen shows different information than the usual algorithm name or parameter values
in this mode. The left two columns of LEDs display level meters for the two audio inputs. The right
section of the screen either shows a rectangle (for recording stopped) or a recording animation
(when recording).

12 The thinking behind this slightly odd name is that it places it alphabetically before any folder beginning with a letter,
and so it is likely to be the first folder in the list when switching to a playback algorithm â so if you want to rapidly
switch from record to playback, you don't have to scroll through a list of folders.

so you can effectively play the disting like a sampler from a MIDI keyboard. MIDI note 48 (C3)
corresponds to a 0V input. MIDI pitch bend is supported; parameter 4 sets the bend depth in
semitones.

Parameter 3 'MIDI mode' works in the same way as for algorithm I-3 â see above.


### Multisample playlists...............................

As with other algorithms, playlist files are optional, but you will almost certainly want to use
playlists within the folders to specify the ânaturalâ and âswitchâ settings that determine the mapping
of samples onto pitch.

Within a folder, if the files looked like this:

then "playlist.txt" might contain

```
disting playlist v1
-loop=0
-retriggerOnSampleChange=0
thumbf2.wav
-natural=41
thumbc3.wav
-switch=44
-natural=48
thumbg3.wav
-switch=52
-natural=55
thumbe4.wav
-switch=60
-natural=64
```
In this case we've turned off looping (the files are quite percussive thumb piano samples) and turned
off retriggerOnSampleChange, so a new sample is chosen only when a trigger is received.

Each sample file uses the â-naturalâ setting to let the algorithm know its 'natural pitch', that is, the
pitch of the audio in the sample as recorded. The setting uses MIDI note numbers, where 48 is C3
(see for example here^13 ). For example the file 'thumbf2.wav' is a recording of an F at 87.3Hz, so its
natural pitch is 41.

The â-switchâ setting tells the algorithm when to choose one sample over another. Again, MIDI
note numbers are used. The files are arranged in order of ascending pitch, and the â-switchâ setting
specifies the lowest pitch that will use that file. In the example above, thumbf2.wav will be used up
to MIDI note 43, then thumbc3.wav up to note 51, thumbg3.wav from 52-59, and finally
thumbe4.wav for notes 60 and up.

With this in mind, the pitch CV is used as follows. The incoming CV is converted to a MIDI note
number â say 49, Câ¯3. First the sample is looked up based on the switch settings â here 49 will
choose thumbc3.wav. This file has natural pitch of 48, so it will be pitched up 1 semitone to play at
the desired pitch.

13 https://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/notes.html


The default for â-switchâ is one up from the previous file in the list. This makes it convenient to
simply list files which are to be mapped onto neighbouring keys e.g.

```
disting playlist v1
-loop=0
-retriggerOnSampleChange=0
-fixedPitch=1.0
GM KICK BASS.wav
-switch=48
GM MED SNARE.wav
GM CLOSED HH.wav
GM OPEN HH .wav
GM PEDAL HH .wav
```
Here five drum samples are mapped onto the five notes from 48 up. Note we've also here specified
â-fixedPitch=1.0â so that the drums are always played at their natural speed.

## J-7 Mono Audio Recorder............................

This algorithm is identical to 'J-5 Audio Recorder' except that the files recorded are in mono, using
the left (X) input, and the files are placed in a folder named '!RECORD1'.

This can be useful when intending to use the recorded audio in the disting's own playback modes,
since mono samples place less stress on the SD card throughput, and can be re-pitched higher.

The _raison d'Ãªtre_ of this algorithm is creating smooth textural loops out of any source material^14. It
is particularly useful for material captured by the disting's own Audio Recorder modes, which won't
have carefully edited loop points. It can also take a clock and adjust the loop time to fit.

In this algorithm, the playlist settings 'loop', 'fadeIn', 'fadeOut', and 'gap' are ignored.

14 Expert Sleepers have long had a love affair with crossfade sample looping. Our plug-in Crossfade Loop Synth dates
back to 2004 (http://expert-sleepers.co.uk/xfadelooper_1_3.html) and is itself inspired by the Roland S-330
hardware sampler (http://www.vintagesynth.com/roland/s330.php), with which we made a lot of music in the early
'90s.


X is a gate or clock input, depending on the parameter 3, 'Gate mode':

```
Parameter value Gate mode
0 X is a gate CV, starting and stopping sample playback.
1 The sample plays continuously.
2 The sample plays continuously. X is a clock CV. The loop length is
adjusted to be related to the time between clocks by a power of two
e.g. 2, 4, 8 but also Â½, Â¼, etc. if the clocks are slower than the
longest possible loop.
```
Note that with nothing plugged in to X, switching between modes 0 & 1 gives you a means to start
and stop playback manually.

Input Y is a pitch CV input following the 1V/octave standard. Note that pitching up a crossfaded
sample places great demands on the SD card throughput, and there is a limit to how high you can
raise the pitch. In our tests, stereo files can only be raised by about a fourth. Mono files can be
played at considerably higher pitches.

The Z knob/CV selects the sample. The transition from one sample to the next is a smooth
crossfade. Note that if the sample has the 'retriggerOnSampleChange' option set to 0, changing Z
will not change the sample â it will only change when playback is stopped and restarted (by the X
CV or manually via parameter 3).

A & B are the left & right audio outputs respectively.

Parameter 0 is the standard sample folder parameter, described above.

Parameter 1 shifts the pitch up & down by octaves. (Note the comments above on how high the
pitch may be raised.)

Parameter 2 sets the crossfade time, in percent of the sample time.


## K-1 Wavetable VCO....................................

```
Video
X is V/Oct pitch input
Y is wavetable input
Z is tune Â±0.5 octaves
A is wavetable output
B is sub-octave square output or detuned output
Receives MIDI
```
```
ParameterMin Max Default Description
0 0 99 0 Chooses the wavetable.
1 -16 8 0 Octave shift.
2 -32 32 0 Y offset.
3 -4 99 0 Output B option/detune.
4 -1 127 -1 Phase.
```
This algorithm is a wavetable VCO. See for example here for a brief overview of wavetable
synthesis.

X is the pitch input for the VCO, with a 1V/octave response. The 0V point for the pitch input is C3
(approximately 130.81Hz).

The Z knob/CV provides a tuning control, with a range of approximately Â±0.5 octaves.

The Y input controls the lookup point in the wavetable, with a range of Â±5V covering the whole
table. Parameter 2 offsets the Y CV, effectively providing a means of manual wave selection.

Output A is the main output of the wavetable VCO.

Output B generates a signal according to parameters 3 and 4. If parameter 4 is -1 (the default), the
output is as follows:

```
Parameter 3 value Output B
-4 MIDI gate.
-3 A Â±8V square wave one octave below output A
-2 Wavetable VCO one octave below output A
-1 Wavetable VCO one octave above output A
0-99 Wavetable VCO detuned relative to output A;
output A is also detuned in the opposite direction.
```
If parameter 4 is 0-99, output B is a copy of output A with a fixed phase offset as defined by the
parameter, scaled so 0-128 corresponds to a phase of 0-360Â°. (So for example if you want
quadrature outputs, set the phase to 32.)

**MIDI Input** : MIDI note messages received on the MIDI channel set in the Settings are converted to
a CV which is added to that on input X. The 0V note is 48 (C3). MIDI notes also drive the 'MIDI
gate' output option.


### Loading wavetables.................................

All wavetable files need to be in a top-level folder on the SD card called 'wavetables'.

Within the 'wavetables' folder, wavetables can take of one two forms: a single WAV file containing
all the waveforms concatenated, or a folder of WAV files, one per waveform.

By default the disting will consider all WAV files and folders of WAV files in the 'wavetables'
folder as wavetables. Optionally (say if you want to reorder the tables) you can specify a playlist:
the wavetables are then listed in the standard playlist format as above, but with the dedicated name
"playlist-wavetable.txt". Each entry is either a WAV file (as in the other playlist formats), in which
case the file is assumed to contain all the waveforms concatenated, or a folder name.

If a folder is specified in "playlist-wavetable.txt", the folder contains the individual WAV files that
represent one waveform each. The algorithm does not use any 'playlist.txt' file within the folder â
any files found files are used in alphabetical order.

Waveform WAVs must be in 16 bit mono format. The sample rate is unimportant, since the file is
assumed to contain exactly one cycle and so can pitched arbitrarily.

When using a single concatenated WAV file, the disting needs to be know how many frames in the
file make up one waveform. This is specified in the playlist via the -wavelength setting (default
600). There are no settings that apply to wavetable folders, nor to the individual files inside the
folders.

To reiterate â the use of playlists is entirely optional if your wavetables are in the form of folders of
individual waveform files.^15

A typical SD card might look like this:

15 This applies from firmware version 4.11 onwards.


An example using a concatenated wavetable file would look like this:

where "playlist-wavetable.txt" contains

```
disting playlist v1
PPG_wavetable_01.wav
-wavelength=256
AKWF_0001
AKWF_0002
```
The first entry 'PPG_wavetable_01.wav' is used as a single WAV file containing concatenated wave
cycles, each of length 256 frames. The remaining entries are taken as folders of individual wave
samples.

## K-2 Clockable Wavetable LFO....................

```
Video
X is clock input
Y is wavetable input
Z is integer multiplier/divider
A & B are wavetable output
ParameterMin Max Default Description
0 0 99 0 Chooses the wavetable.
1 -32 32 0 Y Offset.
2 -32 32 32 Output A attenuverter.
3 -32 32 -32 Output B attenuverter.
4 -15 8 0 LFO time multiplier.
```
This algorithm offers a wavetable oscillator intended for LFO use, though with an audio rate clock
it can also be used at audio frequencies. Consider it a combination of the Wavetable VCO and the
Clockable LFO.

See 'Loading wavetables' above for a description of how to load wavetables onto the SD card.

Input X is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. The time between rising
trigger edges is used to set the cycle time.

The Y input controls the lookup point in the wavetable, with a range of Â±5V covering the whole


table. Parameter 1 offsets the Y CV, effectively providing a means of manual wave selection.

The Z knob/CV sets a scale factor which is applied to the cycle time. The scale is an integer (whole
number) which either multiplies or divides the frequency, and ranges in value from 1-16.

When Z changes, the scale is shown on the display. If the value shown is negative, it is a divisor
rather than a multiplier. Note that there is no value of "-1" since dividing by 1 and multiplying by 1
are the same.

Outputs A & B are the result of the wavetable lookup. Each output has its own attenuverter on
parameters 2 & 3 respectively.

Parameter 4 applies a multiplier to the LFO time, according to the table in the Clockable
Delay/Echo section, above.

## K-3 Wavetable Waveshaper.........................

```
Video
X is signal input
Y is wavetable input
Z is gain
A is wavetable output
B is complementary wavetable output
ParameterMin Max Default Description
0 0 99 0 Chooses the wavetable.
1 -32 32 0 Y Offset.
```
Applied to audio, this algorithm is a wavetable-based waveshaper effect. More generally,
considering the input as a CV lookup, this algorithm provides a wavetable-based transfer function.

See 'Loading wavetables' above for a description of how to load wavetables onto the SD card.

X is the input audio or CV. The range Â±5V spans the full waveform.

Z applies a gain to X, with a range from 1x to approximately 16x.

The Y input controls the lookup point in the wavetable, with a range of Â±5V covering the whole
table. Parameter 1 offsets the Y CV, effectively providing a means of manual wave selection.

Output A is the main output of the wavetable lookup. Output B is the same but using an inverted Y
i.e. when A is using the first wave in the table, B will be using the last and _vice versa_.


## K-4 Clockable Wavetable Envelope.............

```
Video
X is clock input
Y is wavetable input
Z is trigger
A & B are wavetable output
ParameterMin MaxDefault Description
0 0 99 0 Chooses the wavetable.
1 -32 32 0 Y Offset.
2 -32 32 32 Output A attenuverter.
3 -32 32 -32 Output B attenuverter.
4 -15 8 0 Envelope time multiplier.
```
This algorithm is essentially a version of the Clockable Wavetable LFO, but with a trigger input
instead of being free-running. As such it can be thought of as a kind of envelope generator, where
the envelope shape is defined by an audio file in the wavetable.

See 'Loading wavetables' above for a description of how to load wavetables onto the SD card.

Input X is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. The time between rising
trigger edges is used to set the envelope time.

The Y input controls the lookup point in the wavetable, with a range of Â±5V covering the whole
table. Parameter 1 offsets the Y CV, effectively providing a means of manual wave selection.

The Z input is the trigger for the envelope to start.

Outputs A & B are the result of the wavetable lookup. Each output has its own attenuverter on
parameters 2 & 3 respectively.

Parameter 4 applies a multiplier to the envelope time, according to the table in the Clockable
Delay/Echo section, above.


## K-5 Programmable Quantizer.......................

```
Video
A = quantized( X+Y )
B = trigger on note change
Z is slew
Y = pitch or trigger
Outputs MIDI
Parameter MinMax Default Description
0 0 99 0 Scale.
1 0 32 32 Input X attenuation.
2 -1 32 32 Input Y attenuation.
3 -31 31 0 Transpose.
4 0 31 0 Offset.
5 0 1 0 Mode.
```
Output A is a quantized version of the sum of inputs X & Y, according to the scale chosen with
parameter 0.

The scales are defined by files on the MicroSD card â see âScala Supportâ, above. The keyboard
mapping file is used to define the subset of notes that the quantizer may use. For example, in the
provided example files, the file 'root+fifth.kbm' can be used with a 12 note scale to make the
quantizer only output the root or fifth in each octave.

Parameter 5 chooses between two fundamentally different modes of operation. When parameter 5 is
0 (the default), an incoming CV is quantised to the closest pitch value defined by the chosen scale.
When the parameter is 1, the incoming CV is assumed linear 1V/octave and is used to look up a
note in the scale according to the keyboard map, based on the nearest semitone value of the input.

To understand the difference between these two modes, consider a scale with 19 degrees per octave,
and an input CV coming from a ramp LFO. In mode 0, the LFO will step through all 19 tones,
arriving at an octave when the CV is 1V higher than it started. In mode 1, when the LFO rises by
1V, the output will have only risen by 12 degrees of the scale; it will need to rise by another half
Volt or so to reach the octave. Or consider the same situation but with the input from a keyboard,
starting at 0V and rising 1/12th of a Volt per semitone. In mode 0, each semitone will be quantized
to the closest degree of the 19 tone scale, but you'll still only get 12 tones per octave. In mode 1,
playing the keyboard up from, say, C to C will give you 12 tones of the 19 tone scale; you would
need to continue up to the next G to reach the octave.

Output B is a trigger signal which fires whenever output A changes - a 5V pulse approximately
10ms long.

Parameters 1 & 2 are attenuators for inputs X & Y respectively. At 0 the input is completely
attenuated; at 32 the input is unattenuated.

If parameter 2 is set to -1, input Y becomes a trigger. In this mode, input X is only sampled and
converted to a new quantized value when input Y rises over approximately 1V. (In non-triggered
mode, X is constantly sampled and a new note is output as soon as X moves to the next scale
degree.)

Parameter 3 is a transpose control. The transposition occurs after the quantization, and is in terms of
the mapped notes of the scale. For example, if you're using a seven tone scale, with all tones


mapped, then a transposition of 7 raises or lowers the pitch by an octave.

Parameter 4 sets an offset between the timing of the X & Y inputs (in sample frames). When using
Y as a trigger, it is often a good idea to delay it slightly relative to the pitch, to ensure that the pitch
has changed and settled before the trigger samples a new note.

The Z knob/CV controls the slew rate of output A. At the minimum value of Z, changes in A are
instantaneous. As Z increases, changes in A take place more slowly.

**MIDI Output** : each new note (i.e. when the Output B trigger fires) is output as a MIDI note
message on the MIDI channel selected in the settings. The note value is that of the position in the
keyboard mapping of the current output.

## K-6 Clockable SD Delay..............................

```
This algorithm is a delay/echo effect, where the delay time is set from a clock pulse. It is basically
the same as the Clockable Delay/Echo algorithm, except that whereas that algorithm uses the
module's RAM for storage, this one uses the SD card, meaning that the delay time can be much,
much longer â about 95 minutes. It also runs at the full sample rate, so the audio fidelity is higher.

```
SD card requirements
This algorithm is continually reading from and writing to the SD card. You will want a good
quality, high-speed card. A microSDHC card like that recommended above will work well.
The algorithm creates a file on the card called 'DELAY.BIN'. This is created in a very specific
way using low-level card access. Do not mess with the file, or attempt to copy it onto another
SD card for another disting to use. The disting must create the file itself. You can however copy
the file to your computer to process its contents, should you so wish.
It may be that the disting cannot create the file if the card is too fragmented, even if it says it
has enough free space. In this case, the easiest solution is to reformat the card.
```
Input X is the signal input. Any audio signal can be fed in here.

Input Y is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. The time between rising
trigger edges is used to set the delay time. The minimum delay time that can be set is about 90ms.

The Z knob/CV controls the feedback, from zero to a maximum determined by parameter 1. At a
parameter value of 0, the maximum feedback is exactly 100%. At higher values, the maximum
feedback goes over 100%, up to 125% at a parameter value of 8.


Outputs A & B carry signals according to parameter 2:

```
Parameter value Output mode
0 A is mix; B is delay only.
1 A & B are mix.
2 A & B are delay only.
```
'Mix' is a mix of the dry (undelayed) signal and the delay effect. The amount of delay in the mix
rises in direct proportion to the amount of feedback.

'Delay only' is the delayed signal only. Use this and the input signal, plus an external mixer, if you
need more flexibility in the dry/wet balance than is offered by the mixed mode.

Parameter 0 applies a multiplier to the delay time, according to the table in the Clockable
Delay/Echo section, above.

This algorithm is affected by the 'SD delay max' setting â see above.

## K-7 Stereo Clockable SD Delay...................

This is a stereo version of the Clockable SD Delay algorithm as described above.

Being stereo, the maximum delay time is halved, to a mere 48 minutes.

Please be sure to read the 'SD card requirements' box.

This algorithm is affected by the 'SD delay max' setting â see above.

This is a stereo version of the Clockable SD Delay algorithm as described above.

Being stereo, the maximum delay time is halved, to a mere 48 minutes.


Please be sure to read the 'SD card requirements' box.

Since this algorithm uses Z for the clock, the delay feedback is set by parameter 1. A value of 32
corresponds to 100% feedback.

This algorithm is affected by the 'SD delay max' setting â see above.

A stereo reverberation effect.

X and Y are the stereo audio inputs. An equal mix of these is used to feed the reverberator.

A and B are the stereo audio outputs. These are a mix of the inputs and the reverb output.

Z is a wet/dry control. At zero, the output is 100% dry i.e. the input signals with no reverb added.
For positive Z, reverb is added while holding the dry level constant. For negative Z, the dry and
reverb signals are progressively crossfaded, until eventually the output is 100% wet i.e. just the
reverberation signal.

Pressing the Z knob 'freezes' the reverb â the reverb does not decay, and the input signal is not
added into the reverb. Press Z again to unfreeze it.

Parameters 0 & 1 together control the reverb time.

Parameter 2 changes the reverb 'character' - it chooses between a number of options for the reverb
algorithm's internal parameters leading to different sounding reverbs (some quite natural, others
deliberately unnatural).

Parameter 3 applies a low pass filter to the reverb input. It does not affect the dry portion of the
signal.

Parameter 4 is a gain control for the reverb output, in dB. It does not affect the dry signal.

Parameter 5 allows Z to become a CV input for the freeze feature. When the parameter is from -32
to 32, this value is used to control the wet/dry balance, and the Z input becomes a freeze trigger.
The reverb freezes when Z goes above approximately 1V and unfreezes when Z falls below
approximately 0.5V.


Parameter 6 applies a high pass filter to the reverb input. The range of cutoff frequencies is
approximately 3Hz to 1.6kHz.

For positive Z, reverb is added while holding the dry level constant. For negative Z, the dry and
reverb signals are progressively crossfaded, until eventually the outputs are 100% wet i.e. just the

The reverbs freeze when Z goes above approximately 1V and unfreeze when Z falls below

Parameter 6 applies a high pass filter to the reverb input. The range of cutoff frequencies is
approximately 3Hz to 1.6kHz.


##### L-4 Dual Vowel Filter..................................

2 -20 0 0 BPF gain 2.
3 -20 0 -6 BPF gain 3.
```
A dual vowel filter effect. A set of three bandpass filters (BPFs) is used to mimic the response of
the human vocal tract, resulting in vowel-like sounds when provided suitable source material.

The algorithm can be used as a dual-mono effect, or as stereo (in which case you'd want to select
the same vowels for each channel).

Parameters 0 & 1 select the vowel sound for X/A and Y/B respectively. The available sounds are as
follows:

```
Parameter
value
```
```
Vowel Example word
```
```
-1 Chosen from the range below by the Z knob/CV.
0 /ow/ bought
1 /oo/ boot
2 /a/ hot^16
3 /uh/ but
4 /er/ bird
5 /ae/ bat
6 /e/ bet
7 /i/ bit
8 /iy/ beet
```
For a good vowel effect, the input audio should be rich in harmonics. A simple sawtooth works
reasonably well. However, you can of course put any audio you want through the filters.

Parameters 2 & 3 allow fine tuning of the gains of the second and third BPFs, which can be used to
tweak the vowel sounds if they're not quite right for your usage.

16 American pronunciation!


##### L-5 Stereo Chorus.........................................

5 -32 32 0 Fine delay time.
6 1 6 6 Stages.
7 0 1 0 Saturation.
```
A stereo chorus/flange effect.

X is the audio input.

A and B are the stereo audio outputs. These are a mix of the input and the chorus output.

Z is a wet/dry control. At zero, the outputs are 100% dry i.e. the input signal with no chorus added.
For positive Z, chorus is added while holding the dry level constant. For negative Z, the dry and
chorus signals are progressively crossfaded, until eventually the outputs are 100% wet i.e. just the
chorus signals.

The chorus effect is generated via a number of LFOs. The LFO depth is set with parameter 0. The
LFO speeds are set with a combination of parameter 1 and input Y, which is a 1V/octave input
centred on 4Hz for 0V.

Parameter 2 controls a feedback loop around the effect. Parameter 7 engages a saturation stage in
the feedback loop, which can prevent clipping, while adding some colouration to the sound.

Parameter 3 applies a low pass filter to the chorus input. It does not affect the dry portion of the
signals.

Parameters 4 & 5 together set the delay time, with a range of approximately 200ms. Very small
values give flanging; medium values (25-50ms) are more typical for chorus. Larger values give
recognisable echoes.

Parameter 6 sets the number of stages i.e. the number of simultaneous delayed/modulated signals
that combine to produce the effect. Higher values will give a smoother, lusher chorus; small values
are more appropriate to give a sharper, more defined modulation, especially for flanging.

Z is a wet/dry control. At zero, the output A is 100% dry i.e. the input signal with no chorus added.
For positive Z, chorus is added while holding the dry level constant. For negative Z, the dry and

Parameter 2 controls a feedback loop around the effect. Parameter 7 engages a saturation stage in
the feedback loop, which can prevent clipping, while adding some colouration to the sound.

Parameter 3 applies a low pass filter to the chorus input. It does not affect the dry portion of the
signal.

Parameters 4 & 5 together set the delay time, with a range of approximately 200ms. Very small
values give flanging; medium values (25-50ms) are more typical for chorus. Larger values give
recognisable echoes.

Parameter 6 sets the number of stages i.e. the number of simultaneous delayed/modulated signals
that combine to produce the effect. Higher values will give a smoother, lusher chorus; small values
are more appropriate to give a sharper, more defined modulation, especially for flanging.


##### L-7 Mixer....................................................

Video
X & Y are inputs
A is left output
B is right output
Z is pan for input X
Parameter MinMax Default Description
0 -40 6 -6 Input X gain.
1 -40 6 -6 Input Y gain.
2 -32 32 0 Y pan.
```
A simple 2 channel mono-to-stereo mixer.

Parameters 0 & 1 set the gain for inputs X & Y respectively (in dB). At -40 the signal is completely
attenuated (i.e. it's actually ââdB).

Z sets the pan for input X. The pan for input Y is set by parameter 2.

##### L-8 Gate......................................................

```
Video
X is left input
Y is right input
A is left output
B is right output
Z is threshold
```
```
Parameter MinMax Default Description
0 0 99 0 Attack time.
1 0 99 0 Hold time.
2 0 99 0 Release time.
3 0 99 0 Lookahead.
```
A stereo (noise) gate. The outputs are muted unless the input signal exceeds a threshold level.

The Z knob/CV sets the threshold, with a range of approximately 0-8V.

The outputs are muted by an envelope, triggered by the input signal rising above the threshold level.
Parameters 0-2 set the attack, hold and release times of the envelope. The hold time is the minimum
amount of time the envelope is considered to be triggered. The approximate time ranges for each
parameter are: attack 10ms-1.8s, hold 0-600ms, release 45ms-8s.

Parameter 3 sets a lookahead time, effectively delaying the audio slightly relative to the trigger
detection. This can be used to ensure that sharp transients are not lost during the attack time of the
envelope. The maximum lookahead is about 10ms.


##### M-1 Delayed LFO......................................

```
Video
A and B are LFOs, ramps, or ramped LFOs
X is trigger input
Y is ramp time
Z is LFO speed
Parameter MinMax Default Description
0 0 6 1 Output type A.
1 0 6 0 Output type B.
2 -32 32 0 LFO speed range.
3 -32 32 0 Ramp time range.
4 -32 32 32 Attenuverter A.
5 -32 32 32 Attenuverter B.
```
This algorithm combines LFOs and a ramp generator, a combination often used for vibrato which
starts gradually from the beginning of each note. The LFO is in fact not 'delayed' as such, but the
naming is a nod to the equivalent feature on such classic synths as the Juno-6.

Input X triggers the ramp, which starts from zero and ramps linearly up to a maximum over a time
set from Y, which is an exponential, 1V/octave, input. The LFO may be multiplied by the ramp, so
it also starts from zero and ramps up to full amplitude.

The trigger also resets the LFO phase to zero. This could be used even without the ramp to give you
a resettable LFO.

The Z knob/input controls the LFO speed, which is also an exponential control.

Parameters 0 and 1 select the output waveforms on outputs A & B respectively. The choices are:

```
0 the ramp itself
1 triangle affected by ramp
2 sine affected by ramp
3 square affected by ramp
4 triangle
5 sine
6 square
```
Parameters 2 & 3 set the range of the LFO and ramp times, both in quarter octaves (i.e. raising the
value by 4 doubles the speed).

Parameters 4 & 5 are attenuverters for outputs A & B, which apply whatever the selected output
waveforms. Negative values mean you can have a descending ramp, or LFOs with inverted phase.
The unattenuated levels are 0-8V for the ramp and Â±8V for the LFOs.


##### M-2 Scaled LFO.........................................

```
Video
A and B are LFOs
X and Y are min/max or offset/scale
Z is LFO speed
Parameter MinMax Default Description
0 0 6 1 Output type A.
1 0 6 0 Output type B.
2 -32 32 0 LFO speed range.
3 0 1 0 Mode.
4 -48 48 0 X Offset.
5 -48 48 0 Y Offset.
```
This algorithm generates LFOs, the amplitude and DC offset of which is controlled by the input
CVs, according to parameter 3 ('Mode').

If parameter 3 is zero, the X & Y inputs set the minimum and maximum values that the LFO will
reach. For example, if X is 3V and Y is 5V, the LFOs will sweep between 3-5V, or to look at it
another way, the LFOs will be centred at 4V, with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 2V.

If parameter 3 is one, the X input sets the centre of the LFO, while the Y input sets its amplitude.
For example, if X is 3V and Y is 1V, the LFOs' range will be 2V-4V. Note that in this mode if Y is
zero, then A & B follow X. If X is a pitch CV, then you effectively have a vibrato control on Y.

The Z knob/input controls the LFO speed, which is an exponential control.

Parameters 0 and 1 select the output waveforms on outputs A & B respectively. The choices are:

```
0 triangle
1 sine
2 square
3 rising ramp
4 falling ramp
```
Parameter 2 sets the range of the LFO speed, in quarter octaves (i.e. raising the value by 4 doubles
the speed).

Parameters 4 & 5 are offsets applied to inputs X & Y respectively. They are scaled in twelfths of a
Volt, so if interpreted as pitch CVs, in semitones.


##### M-3 Logic...................................................

```
Video
A and B are logic outputs
X and Y are inputs
Z selects logical operation for output A
ParameterMin MaxDefault Description
0 -2 7 0 Output B logical operation.
1 -100 100 20 Input X threshold.
2 -100 100 20 Input Y threshold.
3 -100 100 10 Input X hysteresis.
4 -100 100 10 Input Y hysteresis.
```
This algorithm performs logical operations on the X & Y inputs. The inputs first pass through
adjustable comparators, so you can feed X & Y either with straight gate/trigger signals, or with
more general CVs.

X & Y are the inputs. A & B are the outputs, which are 0/5V logical (on/off) signals.

The Z knob/CV sets the logical operation performed for output A; parameter 0 sets the logical
operation performed for output B. The name of the operation selected for output A is shown in the
display as Z changes; the options available are the same as for output B, excluding the -1 and -2
values below:

```
Parameter 0 value Operation
-2 Output B follows output A
-1 Output B is inverse of output A
0 AND
1 OR
2 XOR
3 NAND
4 NOR
5 XNOR
6 SR flip-flop
7 D flip-flop
```
The SR flip-flop is set high by a rising edge on input X, and cleared low by a rising edge on input
Y.

The D flip-flop takes the level of input X on a rising edge on input Y.

Parameters 1-4 set the input comparator thresholds and hysteresis (for an explanation of hysteresis
see here^17 ). All are scaled such that 100 corresponds to 5V. The input is taken as logical '1' if the
input voltage exceeds the threshold voltage.

##### M-4 Half-wave Rectifier............................

```
Video
A and B are outputs
X and Y are inputs
Z is threshold
Knob recorder enabled
ParameterMin MaxDefault Description
0 0 3 0 Mode.
```
This algorithm processes the inputs with half-wave rectification^18 , in one of two different ways.
Equally useful for audio and CV manipulation, this allows you to split a bipolar signal into its
positive and negative sections, and to combine two different waveforms, using the positive part of
one and the negative part of the other.

For ease of explanation, assume first that the Z knob/CV is at zero.

If the mode (parameter 0) is 0: output A is the positive part of X, plus the negative part of Y. Output
B is the negative part of X, plus the positive part of Y.

If the mode is 1 or 2: the inputs are summed (mode 1) or subtracted (mode 2). Then output A is the
positive part of XÂ±Y, and output B is the negative part of XÂ±Y.

If the mode is 3: output A is the positive part of input X; output B is the positive part of input Y.

Z is a threshold control, allowing the various comparisons above to be against a non-zero value. So
for 'positive part' above read 'part where the value is more than Z' etc.

##### M-5 Stereo Filter........................................

##### M-6 Stereo Tape Delay...............................

```
Video
X is left input
Y is right input
A is left output
B is right output
Z is tape speed or feedback
ParameterMin Max Default Description
0 0 26 26 Tape length.
1 -9 9 0 Fine length control.
2 -1 36 24 Feedback.
3 0 1 0 Output mode.
4 -8 16 0 Tape speed.
```
This is a stereo delay/echo effect which simulates a variable speed tape loop echo device. The delay
time at '1x speed', with the tape length parameter at maximum, is just over 250ms.

X & Y are the audio inputs.

Parameters 0 & 1 together set the 'tape length', effectively setting the delay time. Parameter 0 is
scaled in 10ms increments, while parameter 1 is in 1ms increments (both assuming 1x 'tape speed').

If parameter 2 is 0 or more:

```
Z controls the speed of the 'tape', which also affects the delay time. The speed range is from
half speed to double speed. Parameter 4 is added to the Z value as an offset.
Parameter 2 controls the feedback. A value of 32 gives 100% feedback.
```
If parameter 2 is -1:

```
Z controls the feedback.
Parameter 4 controls the speed of the 'tape', which also affects the delay time. The speed
range is from half speed to double speed.
```
Outputs A & B carry signals according to parameter 3:

```
Parameter value Output mode
0 A & B are mix.
1 A & B are delay only.
```
'Mix' is a mix of the dry (undelayed) signal and the delay effect. The amount of delay in the mix
rises in direct proportion to the amount of feedback.

'Delay only' is the delayed signal only. Use this and the input signals, plus an external mixer, if you
need more flexibility in the dry/wet balance than is offered by the mixed mode.


##### M-7 Granular Pitch Shifter.........................

```
Video
X is audio input
Y is pitch 1V/octave
A is mix output
B is pitch shifted output
Z is mix or freeze
Z press is freeze
```
```
Parameter MinMax Default Description
0 0 99 50 Grain length.
1 0 3 0 Window type.
2 0 32 16 Delay.
3 0 64 0 Feedback.
4 -48 48 0 Y Offset (semitones).
5 -99 99 0 Fine (cents).
6 -65 64 -65 Mix.
```
This is a pitch shifting audio effect, which can also be used as a delay. The pitch shifting is done
using a granular technique, that is, the output is composed of many short segments or 'grains' taken
from the input.

Input X is the audio input.

Input Y is the pitch CV input, following the 1V/octave standard. Positive input voltages shift the
pitch up; negative voltages shift the pitch down.

Output A is a mix of the original audio and the pitch shifted version (according to Z); output B is
the pitch shifted version only.

Z is a wet/dry control. At zero, output A is 100% dry i.e. the input signal only. For positive Z, the
pitch shifted version is added while holding the dry level constant. For negative Z, the dry and pitch
shifted signals are progressively crossfaded, until eventually the output is 100% wet i.e. just the
pitch shifted version.

Parameter 0 sets the grain length. Parameter 1 sets the shape of the grain 'window', or if you prefer,
its envelope. Best results will depend on the source material â experiment.

The effect uses an internal buffer to store the source material so it can be replayed as grains â
therefore there is some delay (or latency) inherent in the algorithm. The delay can be controlled by
parameter 2. If you are only ever pitching down, this can be set very low. Pitching up requires a
higher latency. If you are viewing this as a delay effect, then set the delay to whatever you like. The
maximum delay time is about 400ms.

Parameter 3 sets the delay feedback.

Parameters 4 & 5 provide a means of manually setting a pitch shift without feeding a signal into
input Y. Parameter 4 shifts in semitones, while parameter 5 shifts in cents.

Pressing the Z knob 'freezes' the delay buffer â the input signal is no longer written into the buffer
and the effect will continuously output the frozen material. Press Z again to unfreeze it.

Parameter 6 allows you to set the mix and free up the Z CV input to control Freeze. When the
parameter is at -65 (the default) Z controls the mix. Other values of the parameter set the mix


directly (from 100% wet to dry to an equal mix, just like when controlling it via Z), and the Z input
becomes a gate control for the Freeze function, freezing the buffer when the CV goes over
approximately 1V.

##### M-8 Chaos..................................................

Parameter MinMax Default Description
0 -64 32 0 Range.
1 0 11 0 Outputs.
2 -64 64 32 Atten A.
3 -64 64 32 Atten B.
4 -32 32 0 Offset A.
5 -32 32 0 Offset B.
6 0 1 0 Clamp.
```
This algorithm generates chaotic CVs and/or gates according to the Lorenz equations^19.

The X & Y inputs set parameters of the equations â X affects 'r' (aka 'Ï'), and Y affects 'b' (aka 'Î²').
With the CVs at 0V, the parameters are the classic values as studied by Lorenz (28 and 8/3
respectively).

The A & B outputs generate the x, y or z values of the Lorenz system, or gates based on these
values, according to parameter 1 as follows:

```
Parameter 1 Output A Output B
0 x z
1 y z
2 x y
3 x-based gate z
4 y-based gate z
5 x-based gate y
6 x z-based gate
7 y z-based gate
8 x y-based gate
9 x-based gate z-based gate
10 y-based gate z-based gate
11 x-based gate y-based gate
```
When a gate output is chosen, the output is 5V when the x/y/z value is above zero, and 0V when the
value is below zero. This comparison happen after the scale/offset from parameters 2-5, so the

19 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system


precise gates obtainable are affected by these parameters.

The Z knob/CV sets the speed of the simulation i.e. the rate at which the outputs change.

Parameter 0 sets the range of speed values attainable, in quarter octaves (i.e. raising the value by 4
doubles the speed).

Parameters 2 & 3 are attenuverters for outputs A & B.

Parameters 4 & 5 are offsets for outputs A & B (with a range of Â±8V).

Parameter 6 enables a clamp, in the event that the simulation becomes numerically unstable, in
which case it is reset to initial conditions. With the clamp disabled, the simulation can generate
extreme values, which have nothing to do with the Lorenz equations but are potentially useful in
their own right.

Pushing Z resets the simulation to initial conditions.

##### N-1 Switch..................................................

```

X and Y are inputs
A and B are outputs
Z is control CV or trigger
Knob recorder enabled
ParameterMin MaxDefault Description
0 0 1 0 Mode.
1 0 32 3 Hysteresis.
2 0 99 0 Fade.
3 -1 99 99 Chance.
```
This algorithm is a voltage controlled or triggered crossover switch. That is, either

```
X â A and Y â B
```
or

```
X â B and Y â A
```
Note that by using only one input, the algorithm effectively directs an input to one of two outputs
(e.g. X to either A or B); likewise, using only one output, the algorithm chooses between two inputs
(e.g. A is either X or Y).

Being fully DC-coupled, the algorithm can be used for switching either audio or CV.

Parameter 0 chooses the mode â whether the Z knob/CV is a direct switch or a trigger.

In mode 0, Z is a switch. The switch occurs at 0V. Hysteresis can be applied to the switching
voltage with parameter 1.

In mode 1, Z is a trigger. A positive-going input edge toggles the switch.

When using an external CV as a switch or trigger, you may like to turn the Z knob slightly
counterclockwise.

A crossfade can be applied when switching to avoid clicks. The length of the fade (in milliseconds)
is controlled by parameter 2.


Parameter 3 sets the probability that a switch transition will actually occur when triggered. Add one
to the parameter value to get the chance in %. The default value of 99 means a 100% chance of the
switch transitioning; a value of -1 means a 0% chance i.e. the switch will never change.

##### N-2 Rotary..................................................

```
Video
X is audio input
Y is mix
A and B are stereo outputs

ParameterMin MaxDefault Description

1 0 63 24 Depth.
2 0 99 10 Slew.
3 0 32 15 Crossover.
4 0 64 15 Bass modulation.
```
This algorithm provides an emulation of a rotary speaker effect.

X is the audio input; A & B are the stereo audio outputs.

The dry/wet mix is controlled by the sum of the Y input and parameter 0.

The Z knob/CV controls the rotation speed. The 0-5V range corresponds to speeds from 0.8Hz to
6.7Hz. Below about -1V the speed decreases and eventually stops altogether.

Parameter 1 sets the depth of the pitch modulation.

Parameter 2 sets the slew rate for speed changes. This plus a 5V gate signal into Z are your route to
the classic slow/fast rotary speed transitions.

Parameter 3 controls the frequency of a (first order) crossover filter. The part of the signal above the
filter frequency is fed into the rotary pitch modulation effect. The bass signal (below the crossover
frequency) is not pitch modulated, but is amplitude modulated at a slightly slower rate than the
treble modulation. The depth of the bass modulation is set by parameter 4.

If parameter 3 is zero, the crossover is disabled and the separate bass modulation is not applied.

If the crossover is used, but parameter 4 is zero, this essentially removes the effect entirely from the
bass portion of the input, keeping it centre stereo and at unmodulated pitch.


##### N-5 Pulsar VCO..........................................

ParameterMin Max Default Description

1 0 99 0 Chooses the wave.
2 0 3 0 Window.
3 0 1 0 Y Mode.
4 0 99 0 Masking.
5 -16 8 0 Octave.
```
This algorithm is an implementation of pulsar synthesis, inspired by the description in Curtis
Roads's book Microsound (MIT Press)^20 pp137-157.

In pulsar synthesis, a small grain of sound (known as a _pulsaret_ , typically a pulse or single cycle
waveform) is repeated periodically, followed by a small section of silence. The length of the sound
within the repeating period (equivalently, the speed at which it is played) offers a means of control
the timbre without affecting the perceived pitch of the sound. By the same token, changing the
fundamental pitch without changing the speed at which the grain of sound is played offers pitch
change without simply shifting the entire spectrum up and down, an effect reminiscent of 'vocal' or
'formant' synthesis.

This algorithm uses wavetables from the SD card as the source of the pulsarets. See 'Loading
wavetables' above for a description of how to load wavetables onto the SD card.

Input X sets the fundamental frequency â the rate at which the pulsaret train is generated.

Input Y sets the 'formant' frequency â the rate at which the pulsaret is played. By default this is
independent of the fundamental frequency. If parameter 3 is set to 1, the X input is added to the Y
input, so changing the fundamental frequency also changes the formant frequency.

Parameters 0 & 1 choose the wavetable and the wave within the table, respectively.

Parameter 2 chooses the window or envelope to apply to the pulsaret. The options are:

```
Parameter 2 value Window shape
0 Rectangular
1 Linear attack
2 Linear decay
3 Gaussian
```
The Z knob/CV depends on parameter 4. When parameter 4 is zero (the default), Z is a tuning
control, with a range of approximately Â±0.5 octaves. Otherwise, masking is applied â that is,
pulsarets are omitted from the train. In this case, outputs A & B use inverse masks â output B will
output a pulsaret when output A is suppressed, and _vice versa_. If parameter 4 is 1, stochastic

20 Some of the text of this book is available on Google Books but I would urge you to pick up a physical copy.


masking is applied i.e. pulsarets are randomly masked. The likelihood of a pulsaret being masked is
set by Z. If parameter 4 is 2 or more, burst masking is applied â the parameter sets a number of
pulsarets, and Z controls how many pulsarets within that number will be masked.

Parameter 5 offsets the X input in octave steps.

**MIDI Input** : MIDI note messages received on the MIDI channel set in the Settings are converted to
a CV which is added to that on input X. The 0V note is 48 (C3).

##### N-8 Clockable SD Ping Pong.....................

ParameterMin Max Default Description
0 -15 8 0 Delay time multiplier.
1 0 8 8 Maximum feedback.
2 0 1 0 Output mode.
3 -32 32 -32 Input pan.
```
This is a ping-pong version of the Clockable SD Delay algorithm as described above.

Being stereo, the maximum delay time is halved, to a mere 48 minutes.

Please be sure to read the 'SD card requirements' box.

Outputs A & B are the left and right outputs respectively. If the output mode parameter is 0 (the
default), they are a mix of the dry (undelayed) signal and the delay effect. The amount of delay in
the mix rises in direct proportion to the amount of feedback. If the output mode parameter is 1, the
outputs are the delayed signals only. Use this and the input signal, plus an external mixer, if you
need more flexibility in the dry/wet balance than is offered by output mode 0.

Parameter 2 controls the left/right pan position of the input signal.


#### MIDI I/O.........................................................

##### Introduction................................................

The disting mk4 has a pair of industry standard MIDI ports - one input, one output - which can be
used to connect to a huge variety of external equipment.

##### Connections................................................

The MIDI ports are exposed on a 4-pin expansion header (labelled GT2) at the top of the PCB:

All of the necessary electronics are on the PCB; all that needs to be added is the actual sockets.

The header pin-out is as follows:

```
Pin Function
1 OUT pin 4
2 OUT pin 5
3 IN pin 5
4 IN pin 4
```
Pin numbers refer to the 5-pin DIN socket as in the MIDI standard.

The header is a standard 0.1" pitch header compatible with e.g. typical IDC cable sockets.

##### Breakout module.........................................

A passive breakout module which exposes the MIDI ports as 5-pin DIN sockets is available (also in
kit form). See this page.

##### MIDI "Low-Voltage Signaling".................

When MIDI was first conceived, standard logic circuits ran at 5V, and the initial hardware reference


designs worked on this assumption. However, there is nothing in the MIDI standard that actually
requires a specific voltage, since it operates as a current loop via an opto-isolator.

Nowadays it is much more common for logic to run at 3.3V or lower. The MIDI Manufacturers
Association has now released a reference hardware design based on 3.3V, which they call the
"Low-Voltage Signaling" standard, and it is this that the disting mk4 uses.

The disting is therefore fully compatible with any device that adheres strictly to the MIDI
specification, but may not be with devices that play fast and loose with the spec and assume 5V.

Download the full MIDI electrical specification here.

##### Controlling the disting mk4 via MIDI........

In addition to any algorithm-specific MIDI implementation, there are common MIDI controls
shared by all algorithms. These are as follows. '<in>' for the MIDI channel indicates the MIDI input
channel as selected in the settings.

```

in the settings.
```
##### MIDI Thru..................................................

If enabled in the settings, the MIDI out port echoes any incoming MIDI arriving at the in port. Note
that no attempt is made to process or merge this MIDI stream. If the disting is itself generating
MIDI output, using the Thru function at the same time is likely to result in garbage MIDI output.


#### Calibration.......................................................

Here you will find details of

- How a disting is calibrated.
- How to use the calibration data in your own code.

The disting is calibrated before it leaves the factory. It is not expected that you would need to do
this yourself in normal circumstances.

##### Calibration Procedure.................................

Calibration requires a 3V voltage reference. Any stable and accurate voltage source can be used. It's
a good idea to let the whole system warm up for 5 minutes before calibrating to stabilise any
temperature-dependent factors.

The procedure is as follows:

1. With the disting powered up and with nothing connected to it, use the menu to select option
   5, 'Calibrate'. The message 'GO' will be displayed.
2. Wait a few seconds for the display to show '1' and for the left-most column to flash.
3. Using patch cables (as short as possible), connect output A to input X, and output B to input
   Y.
4. Press the encoder.
5. After a short delay, all four jack sockets should light up red. After another short delay, the
   display will show 'X' and the left-most column will flash.
6. Remove the patch cables. Connect the 3V voltage reference to input X.
7. Verify the reference voltage, and press the encoder.
8. Wait a few seconds for the display to show 'Y' and the left-most column to flash.
9. Connect the 3V voltage reference to input Y.
   10.Verify the reference voltage, and press the encoder.
   11.After a short pause, the disting will reboot, at which point the reference can be removed.

If after step 10 the disting displays the message "Uncalibrated", then the calibration was not
performed correctly, and the data will not be used. Start back at step 1.

##### Calibration Data..........................................

The disting's calibration data is stored in eight 32 bit words from address 0xBD01FE00 (disting
mk1) or 0xBD03FE00 (disting mk2/mk3). The first four refer to the left channel (input X/output
A); the second four refer to the right channel (input Y/output B).

Each value is a sample of the relevant input under certain conditions. These conditions are

1. Input disconnected (and therefore grounded)
2. Input connected to output, output outputting a nominal zero level
3. Input connected to output, output outputting a nominal half full range level
4. Input connected to known 3V reference


From these we can derive constants A, Br, D, Er so that conversion between codec codes and actual
voltages can be handled simply in the code as follows:

```
int vL = ( ( inL - A[0] ) * Br[0] ) >> 24;
int vR = ( ( inR - A[1] ) * Br[1] ) >> 24;
```
```
int cL = ( ( vOutL - D[0] ) * Er[0] ) >> 24;
int cR = ( ( vOutR - D[1] ) * Er[1] ) >> 24;
```
where inL/inR are the values read directly from the audio codec, cL/cR are the codes written
directly to the audio codec, and vL/vR/vOutL/vOutR are .19 format voltages.

The derivation of A, Br, D, Er is as follows:

```
Let the four input samples be zeroIn, zeroOut, halfOut, threeVolt.
A = zeroIn
B = ( threeVolt - zeroIn )/3
Br = 0x80000000000LL / B
D = ( zeroOut - zeroIn )/B
E = ( halfOut - zeroOut )/( B * 0x400000 )
Er = 0x80000000000LL / E
```
The above is pseudo-code - a real C implementation is left as an exercise for the reader.


#### Firmware Updates...........................................

```
Video
```
The disting mk4's firmware can be updated using a Micro SD card. The process is as follows:

- Download the firmware from the Expert Sleepers website^21.
- Unzip the download.
- Copy the file 'disting4.bin' (firmware versions from 4.15 for bootloader version b2) or
  'image.hex' (firmware versions up to 4.14.2 for bootloader version b1) from the unzipped
  download to the root folder of a Micro SD card.
- Turn off the disting and insert the Micro SD card into the socket.
  â¦ The exposed contacts of the card should face towards the display; the angled side of the
  card itself points up.
  â¦ **You are advised to observe basic ESD (electrostatic discharge) precautions** - see for
  example here. Don't be wearing a nylon sweater in an air conditioned room.
- Turn on the disting with the S knob pressed. It will go through the first stage of its startup
  sequence, showing the bootloader version number.
- Keep the S knob pressed until the message "Confirm..." is shown.
  â¦ If at this point the disting shows the message "No firmware found on card", no firmware
  file could be found on the card. Turn off the power, remove the card and check its
  contents.
- Release the knob to begin the update process. (If you change your mind and don't want to
  proceed, simply turn the power off.)
- When the update starts, the display will flash rapidly to indicate progress. Do not remove the
  card or turn off the power during the update.
- When the update is complete, the disting will show the message "Success" if successful, or
  "Error:" plus an error code if there was a problem.
- Turn off the disting and turn it back on to resume normal operation.

Note that the Micro SD card needs to be formatted as FAT32 with MBR partitioning (see the
section on supported cards, above).
