This algorithm is a voltage controlled or triggered crossover switch. That is, either  
**X** → **A** and **Y** → **B**  
or  
**X** → **B** and **Y** → **A**  
Note that by using only one input, the algorithm effectively directs an input to one of two outputs (e.g. **X** to either A
or **B**); likewise, using only one output, the algorithm chooses between two inputs (e.g. **A** is either **X** or **Y**).

Being fully DC-coupled, the algorithm can be used for switching either audio or CV.

Parameter **0** chooses the mode – whether the **Z** knob/CV is a direct switch or a trigger.In mode 0, **Z** is a switch. The
switch occurs at 0V. Hysteresis can be applied to the switching voltage with parameter **1**.

In mode 1, **Z** is a trigger. A positive-going input edge toggles the switch.

When using an external CV as a switch or trigger, you may like to turn the **Z** knob slightly counterclockwise.

A crossfade can be applied when switching to avoid clicks. The length of the fade (in milliseconds) is controlled by
parameter **2**.

Parameter **3** sets the probability that a switch transition will actually occur when triggered. Add one to the parameter
value to get the chance in %. The default value of 99 means a 100% chance of the switch transitioning; a value of -1
means a 0% chance i.e. the switch will never change.
