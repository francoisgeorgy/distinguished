A dual vowel filter effect . A set of three bandpass filters (BPFs) is
used to mimic the response of the human vocal tract, resulting in
vowel-like sounds when provided suitable source material.

The algorithm can be used as a dual-mono effect, or as stereo (in
which case you'd want to select the same vowels for each channel).

Parameters **0** & **1** select the vowel sound for **X**/A and **Y**/B respectively.
The available sounds are as follows:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Parameter</strong>
<strong>value</strong></th>
<th><strong>Vowel</strong></th>
<th><strong>Example word</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>-1</td>
<td>Chosen from the range below by the **Z** knob/CV.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>0</td>
<td>/ow/</td>
<td>bought</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1</td>
<td>/oo/</td>
<td>boot</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2</td>
<td>/a/</td>
<td>hot16</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3</td>
<td>/uh/</td>
<td>but</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>4</td>
<td>/er/</td>
<td>bird</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>5</td>
<td>/ae/</td>
<td>bat</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>6</td>
<td>/e/</td>
<td>bet</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>7</td>
<td>/i/</td>
<td>bit</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>8</td>
<td>/iy/</td>
<td>beet</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

For a good vowel effect, the input audio should be rich in harmonics.
A simple sawtooth works reasonably well. However, you can of course
put any audio you want through the filters.

Parameters **2** & **3** allow fine tuning of the gains of the second and
third BPFs, which can be used to tweak the vowel sounds if they're not
quite right for your usage.
