This is a stereo version of the Clockable SD Delay algorithm as described above.Being stereo, the maximum delay time is
halved, to a mere 48 minutes.

Please be sure to read the 'SD card requirements' box.

Since this algorithm uses **Z** for the clock, the delay feedback is set by parameter **1** . A value of 32 corresponds to 100%
feedback.

This algorithm is affected by the 'SD delay max' setting â€“ see above.
