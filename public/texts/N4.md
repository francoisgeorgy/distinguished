This algorithm is a stereo low pass gate, that is, a combination of low pass filter and VCA. 
It makes no claim to emulate any particular bit of hardware, classic or modern, but the response 
of the filter to a 'strike' on the frequency input has been designed to be somewhat like that 
of a vactrol-based low pass gate.

**X** & **Y** are the audio inputs; 

**A** & **B** are the audio outputs.

**Z** controls the filter frequency/VCA CV. This has slew applied to it, which is controlled by parameters **1** & **2**.

Parameter **0** sets the filter resonance.
