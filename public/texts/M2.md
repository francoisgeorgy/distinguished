This algorithm generates LFOs, the amplitude and DC offset of which is controlled by the input CVs, according to
parameter **3** ('Mode').

If parameter **3** is zero, the **X** & **Y** inputs set the minimum and maximum values that the LFO will reach. For example, if **X**
is 3V and **Y** is 5V, the LFOs will sweep between 3-5V, or to look at it another way, the LFOs will be centred at 4V, with
a peak-to-peak amplitude of 2V.

If parameter **3** is one, the **X** input sets the centre of the LFO, while the **Y** input sets its amplitude. For example, if **X**
is 3V and **Y** is 1V, the LFOs' range will be 2V-4V. Note that in this mode if **Y** is zero, then **A** & **B** follow **X**. If **X** is a
pitch CV, then you effectively have a vibrato control on **Y**.

The **Z** knob/input controls the LFO speed, which is an exponential control.

Parameters 0 and 1 select the output waveforms on outputs **A** & **B** respectively. The choices are:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>0</th>
<th>triangle</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1</td>
<td>sine</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2</td>
<td>square</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3</td>
<td>rising ramp</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>4</td>
<td>falling ramp</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Parameter **2** sets the range of the LFO speed, in quarter octaves (i.e. raising the value by 4 doubles the speed).

Parameters 4 & 5 are offsets applied to inputs **X** & **Y** respectively. They are scaled in twelfths of a Volt, so if
interpreted as pitch CVs, in semitones.
