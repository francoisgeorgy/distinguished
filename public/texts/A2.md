Output **A** is the result of multiplying inputs **X** & **Y**. Output **B** is the
inverse of output A.

If for example **X** is a signal and **Y** is an envelope, then this algorithm
is a VCA. If both inputs are signals, then this is a ring modulator.

The **Z** knob/CV sets a scale factor which is applied to both outputs. The scale is an integer (whole number) which either
multiplies or divides the result, and ranges in value from 1-10.

When **Z** changes, the scale is shown on the display. If the value shown is negative, it is a divisor rather than a
multiplier. Note that there is no value of "-1" since dividing by 1 and multiplying by 1 are the same. After a short
while the display reverts to showing the current algorithm.

When parameter **0** is 1, the scale is not restricted to integer steps, and changes smoothly with **Z**.

  **Parameter 1** applies an offset to the **Y** input, in whole Volts. This is convenient if you just want to multiply the **X**
input by a constant, which you can then dial in with the **Y** Offset and **Z**.
