This algorithm processes the inputs with half-wave rectification, in
one of two different ways.

Equally useful for audio and CV manipulation, this allows you to split
a bipolar signal into its positive and negative sections, and to
combine two different waveforms, using the positive part of one and
the negative part of the other.

For ease of explanation, assume first that the **Z** knob/CV is at zero.

If the mode (parameter **0**) is 0: output **A** is the positive part of **X**,
plus the negative part of **Y**. Output **B** is the negative part of **X**, plus
the positive part of **Y**.

If the mode is 1 or 2: the inputs are summed (mode 1) or subtracted
(mode 2). Then output **A** is the positive part of **X**±Y, and output **B** is
the negative part of **X**±Y.

If the mode is 3: output **A** is the positive part of input **X**; output **B**
is the positive part of input **Y**.

**Z** is a threshold control, allowing the various comparisons above to be
against a non-zero value. So for 'positive part' above read 'part
where the value is more than **Z**' etc.
