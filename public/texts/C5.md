This algorithm implements a resonator, which is a kind of filter, but which is also often found as the basis for analogue drum synthesis.

 **X** is the input for the signal to filter. If used as a drum synth, this is the trigger input. The amplitude and nature of
the trigger signal will affect the resulting sound. If parameter **1** is set to '1', the input is treated as an actual
trigger, not an audio signal, triggering a pulse when the input goes over 1V.

 **Y** sets the pitch of the resonator, with a 1V/octave response. The 0V point for the pitch input is C3 (approximately
130.81Hz). Parameter **0** provides a pitch offset in semitones.

**Z** sets the gain. In terms of drum synthesis, more gain means a longer decay time.

 **A** is the audio output.

 **B** outputs the result of envelope tracking the audio output A.

Pressing **Z** simulates hitting **X** with a 1ms 5V pulse, and so works as a manual trigger of the 'drum'.
