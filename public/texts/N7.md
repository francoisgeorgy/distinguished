This algorithm is a frequency shifter. Note that this is very different from a pitch shifter.
**X** is the audio input. **A** and **B** are the audio outputs.

The **Y input** controls the frequency shift. If **parameter 2** is 1, the Z knob/CV is also added to the
total shift.

**Parameter 0** sets the range of the shift CV, from 1Hz/Volt up to 1kHz/Volt.

**Parameter 1** controls whether output B uses the same shift as output A or the opposite shift. Small
opposite shifts can give a pleasing chorus type sound.
