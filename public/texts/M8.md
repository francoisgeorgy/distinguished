This algorithm generates chaotic CVs and/or gates according to the 19.

The **X** & **Y** inputs set parameters of the equations – **X** affects 'r' (aka
'ρ'), and **Y** affects 'b' (aka 'β'). With the CVs at 0V, the parameters
are the classic values as studied by Lorenz (28 and 8/3 respectively).

The **A** & **B** outputs generate the x, y or z values of the Lorenz system,
or gates based on these values, according to parameter **1** as follows:

When a gate output is chosen, the output is 5V when the x/y/z value is
above zero, and 0V when the value is below zero. This comparison
happen after the scale/offset from parameters 2-5, so the precise gates obtainable are affected by these parameters.

The **Z** knob/CV sets the speed of the simulation i.e. the rate at which the outputs change.

Parameter **0** sets the range of speed values attainable, in quarter octaves (i.e. raising the value by 4 doubles the
speed).

Parameters 2 & 3 are attenuverters for outputs **A** & **B**.

Parameters 4 & 5 are offsets for outputs **A** & **B** (with a range of ±8V).

Parameter **6** enables a clamp, in the event that the simulation becomes numerically unstable, in which case it is reset to
initial conditions. With the clamp disabled, the simulation can generate extreme values, which have nothing to do with
the Lorenz equations but are potentially useful in their own right.

Pushing **Z** resets the simulation to initial conditions.
