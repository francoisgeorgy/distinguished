**Receives MIDI**

This algorithm is a wavetable VCO. See for example for a brief overview of wavetable synthesis.

X is the pitch input for the VCO, with a 1V/octave response. The 0V point for the pitch input is C3 (approximately
130.81Hz).

The Z knob/CV provides a tuning control, with a range of approximately ±0.5 octaves.

The Y input controls the lookup point in the wavetable, with a range of ±5V covering the whole table. Parameter 2
offsets the Y CV, effectively providing a means of manual wave selection.

Output A is the main output of the wavetable VCO.

Output B generates a signal according to parameters 3 and 4. If parameter 4 is -1 (the default), the output is as
follows:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Parameter 3 value</strong></th>
<th><strong>Output B</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>-4</td>
<td>MIDI gate.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>-3</td>
<td>A ±8V square wave one octave below output A</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>-2</td>
<td>Wavetable VCO one octave below output A</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>-1</td>
<td>Wavetable VCO one octave above output A</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>0-99</td>
<td>Wavetable VCO detuned relative to output A; output A is also detuned in the opposite direction.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

If parameter 4 is 0-99, output B is a copy of output A with a fixed phase offset as defined by the parameter, scaled so
0-128 corresponds to a phase of 0-360°. (So for example if you want quadrature outputs, set the phase to 32.)

**MIDI Input**: MIDI note messages received on the MIDI channel set in the Settings are converted to a CV which is added
to that on input X. The 0V note is 48 (C3). MIDI notes also drive the 'MIDI gate' output option.

**Loading wavetables**  
All wavetable files need to be in a top-level folder on the SD card
called 'wavetables'.

Within the 'wavetables' folder, wavetables can take of one two forms:
a single WAV file containing all the waveforms concatenated, or a
folder of WAV files, one per waveform.

By default the disting will consider all WAV files and folders of WAV
files in the 'wavetables' folder as wavetables. Optionally (say if you
want to reorder the tables) you can specify a playlist: the wavetables
are then listed in the standard playlist format as above, but with the
dedicated name "playlist-wavetable.txt". Each entry is either a WAV
file (as in the other playlist formats), in which case the file is
assumed to contain all the waveforms concatenated, or a folder name.

If a folder is specified in "playlist-wavetable.txt", the folder
contains the individual WAV files that represent one waveform each.
The algorithm does not use any 'playlist.txt' file within the folder –
any files found files are used in alphabetical order.

Waveform WAVs must be in 16 bit mono format. The sample rate is
unimportant, since the file is assumed to contain exactly one cycle
and so can pitched arbitrarily.

When using a single concatenated WAV file, the disting needs to be
know how many frames in the file make up one waveform. This is
specified in the playlist via the -wavelength setting (default 600).
There are no settings that apply to wavetable folders, nor to the
individual files inside the folders.

To reiterate – the use of playlists is entirely optional if your
wavetables are in the form of folders of individual waveform files.15

A typical SD card might look like this:

<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image8.png" style="width:6.69306in;height:2.85833in" />

15 This applies from firmware version 4.11 onwards.

An example using a concatenated wavetable file would look like this:  
<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image9.png" style="width:6.69306in;height:2.85833in" />

where "playlist-wavetable.txt" contains

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>disting playlist v1<br />
PPG_wavetable_01.wav<br />
-wavelength=256<br />
AKWF_0001<br />
AKWF_0002</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The first entry 'PPG\_wavetable\_01.wav' is used as a single WAV file containing concatenated wave cycles, each of
length 256 frames. The remaining entries are taken as folders of individual wave samples.
