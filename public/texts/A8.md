This algorithm provides two independent waveshaping functions. 

The **Z** knob/CV is a gain control, with a range of approximately 30x. Negative values of **Z** invert the signal.

Output **A** provides a waveshaped version of input **X**.

Output **B** provides a waveshaped version of input **Y**.

Parameters **0** & **1** choose what type of waveshaping is applied.

Type 0 is what is usually termed a wavefolder. This increases the harmonic content of the sound in interesting ways,
especially as the gain changes.

Type 1 is a triangle-to-sine waveshaper. Used on most audio this is a relatively gentle form of overdrive/saturation.
However, when fed with the right level of triangle wave, the output is exactly a sine wave, which is useful when you
have a triangle wave VCO handy but really want a pure sine wave instead.
