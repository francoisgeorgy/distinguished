This algorithm is much the same as the base I-1 Audio Playback algorithm, except that it forgoes voltage control of the
current sample and instead offers control over the sample end point.

**X** and **Z** are the retrigger and end position controls.

If **Z** is negative, **X** is the retrigger input, and **Z** controls the sample end point. So, if you
require manual control over the end point, turn the **Z** knob counterclockwise to shorten the

If **Z** is positive, **Z** is the retrigger input, and **X** controls the sample end point. In this case **X**
is scaled in the same way as input **Y**, so varying **Y** and feeding **X** the same CV plus a small
offset will give you a short segment of the sample that moves around with the input. The
trigger fed into **Z** should be a positive pulse over about 1V.

When **Z** is adjusted through the switching point between these two modes, the display will show "Xt" or "Zt" (for **X**
trigger or **Z** trigger) for a short while.

The current sample is selected via parameter **1**.

Parameters **0** & **2** are the standard sample folder and envelope time parameters, described above.**MIDI Input**: MIDI note
on & off messages are handled equivalently to a trigger or gate on the **X** input â€“ that is, a note on retriggers the
sample, and if the envelope time is non-zero, a note off will stop the playback.
