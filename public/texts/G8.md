**Outputs MIDI**

Generates MIDI notes (on the MIDI channel selected in the settings) from the pitch and gate CVs on the X & Y inputs.

Parameter 0 sets an offset between the timing of the X & Y inputs (in sample frames). It is generally a good idea to
delay the pitch slightly relative to the gate, to ensure that the pitch has changed and settled before the gate triggers
a new note.

Parameter 1 chooses the function of the Z knob/CV. If 0, Z sets the velocity of the generated MIDI notes. Otherwise, Z
generates CC messages using the parameter value as the CC number, and the note velocity is fixed at 64.

Parameters 2 & 3, when non-zero, allow you to generate CC messages from the X & Y inputs (using the parameter value as
the CC number). If Y is to be converted to a CC, then notes are no longer generated.
