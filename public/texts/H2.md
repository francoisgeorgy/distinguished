**If parameter 0 is 0 (the default)**:  
Output **A** is a sample of input **X**, taken when the trigger input **Z** goes over 1V. (Sample and Hold) **If parameter **0** is
1**:  
Output **A** follows input **X** while input **Z** is over 1V. When **Z** falls below 0.5V, output **A** is held until **Z** goes over 1V
again. (Track and Hold)

Similarly for output **B**/input **Y**.

Pressing the **Z** knob triggers a sample manually.

Parameter **1** sets an offset between the timing of the **X/Y** & **Z** inputs (in sample frames). If **X/Y** & **Z** are being driven
together, for example by a sequencer's pitch and gate, it is often a good idea to delay the trigger slightly to allow
time for the sampled CV to settle before the sample is taken.

Parameters **2** & **3** add white noise into the signal from inputs **X** & **Y** respectively, allowing you to use the algorithm as a
source of random voltages without having to patch anything into the inputs.

Parameters **4** & **5** control the amount of slew applied to outputs **A** & **B** respectively.
