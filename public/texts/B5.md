Outputs **A** & **B** are LFOs (low frequency oscillators), with CV control of frequency and waveshape. The output signals are
±8V (16V peak-to-peak) by default, but can be attenuated via the parameters.

The outputs can also have a DC offset applied. The offset in Volts is (parameter value)/4 i.e. the range is ±10V, in steps of 0.25V.

Input **X** is a Hz/V frequency control, scaled at 1Hz/V. Note that the input is allowed to go negative, resulting in a
phase-reversed output.

Knob/CV **Z** is a tuning control, with a range of approximately ±10Hz. This is simply added to the setting from input **X** (so
with input **X** disconnected, the knob can be used to manually set an LFO rate).

Input **Y** controls the waveshape of the output signals. Signals in the range ±5V give the full range of possible
waveshapes:

  **Parameter 4** offsets the **Y** input, providing a way to set the waveshape manually.
