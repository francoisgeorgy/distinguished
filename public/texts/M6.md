This is a stereo delay/echo effect which simulates a variable speed tape loop echo device. The delay time at '1x speed',
with the tape length parameter at maximum, is just over 250ms.

**X** & **Y** are the audio inputs.

Parameters **0** & **1** together set the 'tape length', effectively setting the delay time. Parameter **0** is scaled in 10ms
increments, while parameter **1** is in 1ms increments (both assuming 1x 'tape speed').

If parameter **2** is 0 or more:

**Z** controls the speed of the 'tape', which also affects the delay time.
The speed range is from half speed to double speed. Parameter **4** is
added to the **Z** value as an offset.

Parameter **2** controls the feedback . A value of 32 gives 100% feedback.

If parameter **2** is -1:  
**Z** controls the feedback.

Parameter **4** controls the speed of the 'tape', which also affects the
delay time. The speed range is from half speed to double speed.

Outputs **A** & **B** carry signals according to parameter **3**:

<tr class="odd">
<td>0</td>
<td>**A** &amp; **B** are mix.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>1</td>
<td>**A** &amp; **B** are delay only.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

'Mix' is a mix of the dry (undelayed) signal and the delay effect. The amount of delay in the mix rises in direct
proportion to the amount of feedback.

'Delay only' is the delayed signal only. Use this and the input signals, plus an external mixer, if you need more
flexibility in the dry/wet balance than is offered by the mixed mode.
