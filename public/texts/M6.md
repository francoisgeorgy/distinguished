This is a stereo delay/echo effect which simulates a variable speed tape loop echo device. The delay time at '1x speed',
with the tape length parameter at maximum, is just over 250ms.

**X** & **Y** are the audio inputs.

Parameters **0** & **1** together set the 'tape length', effectively setting the delay time. Parameter **0** is scaled in 10ms
increments, while parameter **1** is in 1ms increments (both assuming 1x 'tape speed').

If parameter **2** is 0 or more **Z** controls the speed of the 'tape', which also affects the delay time.
The speed range is from half speed to double speed. Parameter **4** is
added to the **Z** value as an offset.

Parameter **2** controls the feedback . A value of 32 gives 100% feedback.

If parameter **2** is -1 **Z** controls the feedback.

Parameter **4** controls the speed of the 'tape', which also affects the
delay time. The speed range is from half speed to double speed.

**Outputs A** & **B** are the left and right outputs respectively.

**Parameter 0** controls the output mix between the dry signal and the delay signal. At the default
value of -33, the amount of delay in the mix rises in direct proportion to the amount of feedback.
For values from -32 to 0, the output crossfades between the delay (at -32) and the dry signal (at 0).
For values above 0, the dry signal level is constant and the delay signal level rises with the
parameter value.
