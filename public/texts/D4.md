This is a 2nd-order filter, with a voltage controllable response type. **B**y varying **Z**, the output can be low pass, band
pass or high pass, or blends in between.

X is the audio input.

**Y** sets the filter frequency, with a 1V/octave response. The 0V point is C3 (approximately 130.81Hz). Parameter **0** is
added to the **Y** CV; its range of ±80 corresponds to ±5V.

Z sets the filter type output at **A** & **B**.

Output **A** blends smoothly between low pass (at minimum **Z**), through band pass (at zero **Z**), to high pass (at maximum **Z**).

Output **B** blends smoothly between high pass (at minimum **Z**), through band pass (at zero **Z**), to low pass (at maximum **Z**).

Parameter **1** sets the filter resonance.
