This algorithm is a stereo ping-pong delay/echo effect, primarily intended for processing audio signals, where the delay
time is set from a clock pulse. It operates at a quarter of the standard sample rate
(i.e. at about 19kHz) and offers a maximum delay time of about 900ms.

Input **X** is the signal input. Any audio signal can be fed in here.

Input **Y** is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. The time between rising trigger edges is used
to set the delay time. If the time between triggers is greater than the maximum delay time, the time is divided by two
until it is small enough. This way, you always end up with a rhythmically useful delay time.

Parameter **1** applies a multiplier to the delay time, according to the table above.

The **Z** knob/CV controls the feedback, from zero to slightly more than 100%.

Outputs **A** & **B** are the left and right outputs respectively. 

**Parameter 0** controls the output mix between the dry signal and the delay signal. At the default
value of -33, the amount of delay in the mix rises in direct proportion to the amount of feedback.
For values from -32 to 0, the output crossfades between the delay (at -32) and the dry signal (at 0).
For values above 0, the dry signal level is constant and the delay signal level rises with the
parameter value.

Parameter **2** controls the left/right pan position of the input signal.
