This algorithm plays audio files, using a 1V/octave pitch input (Y) to
both select the sample and control its pitch. This would typically be
used for playing a multisampled instrument across a range of pitches,
or for mapping individual sounds (e.g. drums) to different notes.

**X** is a retrigger input . A trigger pulse in excess of 1V will reset the
playback position to the start of the sample.

The **Z** knob/CV provides a tuning control, with a range of approximately
±0.5 octaves. Note that this is applied after the sample has been
selected using the **Y** CV; changing **Z** will not affect the sample
selection.

**A** & **B** are the left & right audio outputs respectively.

Parameter **1** shifts the pitch up or down in octave increments. It is
equivalent to offsetting the pitch CV input – it also affects the
sample selection.

Parameters **0** & **2** are the standard sample folder and envelope time
parameters, described above.

Parameter **5** offsets (delays) the retrigger/gate input relative to the
pitch input. This is useful to allow pitch CVs to settle before they
are sampled on the rising gate, and also to cope with modules which
output both a pitch and gate but change their pitch first. In both
cases, an offset allows the algorithm to choose the correct sample,
rather than choosing the wrong sample and then re-pitching it to match
the CV.

**MIDI Input**: MIDI note on & off messages are handled equivalently
to a trigger or gate on the **X** input – that is, a note on retriggers
the sample, and if the envelope time is non-zero, a note off will stop
the playback. Additionally, the pitch of the note on message is used
instead of the **Y** input CV, so you can effectively play the disting
like a sampler from a MIDI keyboard. MIDI note 48 (C3) corresponds to
a 0V input. MIDI pitch bend is supported; parameter **4** sets the bend
depth in semitones.

Parameter **3** 'MIDI mode' works in the same way as for algorithm I-3 –
see above.

**Multisample playlists**

As with other algorithms, playlist files are optional, but you will
almost certainly want to use playlists within the folders to specify
the “natural” and “switch” settings that determine the mapping of
samples onto pitch.

Within a folder, if the files looked like this:  
<img src="ef251f30afcb4aceb4f72b4bc9795a77/media/image7.png" style="width:3.63333in;height:1.24861in" />

then "playlist.txt" might contain

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>disting playlist v1<br />
-loop=0<br />
-retriggerOnSampleChange=0<br />
thumbf2.wav<br />
-natural=41<br />
thumbc3.wav<br />
-switch=44<br />
-natural=48<br />
thumbg3.wav<br />
-switch=52<br />
-natural=55<br />
thumbe4.wav<br />
-switch=60<br />
-natural=64</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

In this case we've turned off looping (the files are quite percussive
thumb piano samples) and turned off retriggerOnSampleChange, so a new
sample is chosen only when a trigger is received.

Each sample file uses the “-natural” setting to let the algorithm know
its 'natural pitch', that is, the pitch of the audio in the sample as
recorded. The setting uses MIDI note numbers, where 48 is C3 (see for
example 13). For example the file 'thumbf2.wav' is a recording of an F
at 87.3Hz, so its natural pitch is 41.

The “-switch” setting tells the algorithm when to choose one sample
over another. Again, MIDI note numbers are used. The files are
arranged in order of ascending pitch, and the “-switch” setting
specifies the lowest pitch that will use that file. In the example
above, thumbf2.wav will be used up to MIDI note 43, then thumbc3.wav
up to note 51, thumbg3.wav from 52-59, and finally  
thumbe4.wav for notes 60 and up.

With this in mind, the pitch CV is used as follows. The incoming CV is
converted to a MIDI note number – say 49, C♯3. First the sample is
looked up based on the switch settings – here 49 will choose
thumbc3.wav. This file has natural pitch of 48, so it will be pitched
up 1 semitone to play at the desired pitch.

The default for “-switch” is one up from the previous file in the
list. This makes it convenient to simply list files which are to be
mapped onto neighbouring keys e.g.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>disting playlist v1<br />
-loop=0<br />
-retriggerOnSampleChange=0<br />
-fixedPitch=1.0<br />
GM KICK **B**ASS.wav<br />
-switch=48<br />
GM MED SNARE.wav<br />
GM CLOSED HH.wav<br />
GM OPEN HH .wav<br />
GM PEDAL HH .wav</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Here five drum samples are mapped onto the five notes from 48 up. Note
we've also here specified “-fixedPitch=1.0” so that the drums are
always played at their natural speed.
