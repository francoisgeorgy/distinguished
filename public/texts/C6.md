This algorithm implements a vocoder. The spectral characteristics of the modulator input are applied to the carrier
input. In classic usage, the modulator might be a human voice, and the carrier might be a synth sound, or simply noise.

 **X** is the modulator input, and **Y** is the carrier input.

 **A** is the audio output. 

 **B** outputs a CV related to the envelope of the modulator signal.

The **Z** control sets the decay time of the internal envelope trackers, which track each band of the modulator signal. Use
low values (negative **Z**) for most intelligible speech.

Parameter **0** selects between alternative filter banks:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Bank</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>0</strong></td>
<td>
Half octave spacing, based on 100Hz.
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>1</strong></td>
<td>
Third octave spacing, based on 250Hz.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Parameters **1** & **2** provide attenuation or gain of outputs **A** & **B** respectively.
