This algorithm is much the same as E-4 Stereo Compressor above, except that the gain reduction is driven not by the
audio signal itself, but by a side-chain input. Refer to the description of E-4 for explanation of the common parameters
not detailed below.

The Z knob/CV is the side-chain input. If you're using an audio signal here, you'll want to set the knob to its
central (un-illuminated)
position first. However, you can also use Z with any CV to control the gain reduction directly.

Parameter 5 sets the compression ratio, with a range from 1 (no compression) to infinity (effectively limiting rather
than compression).
