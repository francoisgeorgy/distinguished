Output **A** is the minimum of inputs **X** & **Y**.

Output **B** is the maximum of the two inputs. 

If one input is zero (or disconnected), this is a half-wave rectifier.

The **Z** knob/CV provides a gate function. When **Z** goes higher than approximately 2.5V, the gate goes high and the outputs
follow the inputs according to the min/max relationship. When **Z** goes below approximately -1.5V, the gate goes low and
the outputs are frozen.

When the gate changes state, "LO" or "HI" is displayed to indicate the gate status. After a short while the display
reverts to showing the current algorithm.
