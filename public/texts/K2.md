This algorithm offers a wavetable oscillator intended for LFO use, though with an audio rate clock it can also be used
at audio frequencies. Consider it a combination of the Wavetable VCO and the Clockable LFO.

See 'Loading wavetables' above for a description of how to load wavetables onto the SD card.

Input X is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. The time between rising trigger edges is used
to set the cycle time.

The Y input controls the lookup point in the wavetable, with a range of Â±5V covering the whole

table. Parameter 1 offsets the Y CV, effectively providing a means of manual wave selection.

The Z knob/CV sets a scale factor which is applied to the cycle time. The scale is an integer (whole number) which
either multiplies or divides the frequency, and ranges in value from 1-16.

When Z changes, the scale is shown on the display. If the value shown is negative, it is a divisor rather than a
multiplier. Note that there is no value of "-1" since dividing by 1 and multiplying by 1 are the same.

Outputs A & B are the result of the wavetable lookup. Each output has its own attenuverter on parameters 2 & 3
respectively.

Parameter 4 applies a multiplier to the LFO time, according to the table in the Clockable Delay/Echo section, above.
