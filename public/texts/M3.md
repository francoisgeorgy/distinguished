This algorithm performs logical operations on the **X** & **Y** inputs. The
inputs first pass through adjustable comparators, so you can feed **X** &
**Y** either with straight gate/trigger signals, or with more general CVs.

**X** & **Y** are the inputs. **A** & **B** are the outputs, which are 0/5V logical
(on/off) signals.

The **Z** knob/CV sets the logical operation performed for output A;
parameter **0** sets the logical operation performed for output **B**. The
name of the operation selected for output **A** is shown in the display as
**Z** changes; the options available are the same as for output **B**,
excluding the -1 and -2 values below:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Parameter **0** value</strong></th>
<th><strong>Operation</strong></th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>-2</td>
<td>Output **B** follows output A</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>-1</td>
<td>Output **B** is inverse of output A</td>

<tr class="odd">

<td>XNOR</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>6</td>
<td>SR flip-flop</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>7</td>
<td>D flip-flop</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The SR flip-flop is set high by a rising edge on input **X**, and cleared
low by a rising edge on input **Y**.

The D flip-flop takes the level of input **X** on a rising edge on input
Y.

Parameters 1-4 set the input comparator thresholds and hysteresis (for
an explanation of hysteresis see 17). All are scaled such that 100
corresponds to 5V. The input is taken as logical '1' if the input
voltage exceeds the threshold voltage.
