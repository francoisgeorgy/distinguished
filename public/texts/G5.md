This algorithm provides a chromatic tuner. The pitch of the input signal is tracked and displayed as a note name, with
indication of whether the note is sharp or flat.

Natural notes are shown in capitals i.e. 'C', 'D', 'E' etc. Lower case letters indicate sharps e.g. 'c' indicates C
sharp, 'd', indicates D sharp.

Following the note name a '-' indicates that the note is below the true pitch (flat) and '+' indicates that the note is
above the true pitch
(sharp). If the note is within 1 cent of the true pitch, neither '-' nor
'+' is shown.

Output **A** is a copy of X, so the tuner can be left inline without needing a mult.

Output **B** is a sine wave at the pitch of the detected note. The amplitude of the sine wave is set by the **Z** knob/CV.
