This algorithm provides a chromatic tuner. 

The pitch of the input signal is tracked and displayed as a note name, with
indication of whether the note is sharp or flat.

Natural notes are shown in capitals i.e. 'C', 'D', 'E' etc. Lower case letters indicate sharps e.g. 'c' indicates C
sharp, 'd' indicates D sharp.

The fifth column of LEDs in the display shows the octave.

The sixth and seventh columns show how far away from the correct pitch the note is. 
When the note is tuned, the sixth column will be blank and the seventh will have the centre LED lit.

Output **A** is a copy of **X**, so the tuner can be left inline without needing a mult.

Output **B** is a sine wave at the pitch of the detected note. The amplitude of the sine wave is set by the **Z** knob/CV.

Parameter **0** sets the tuning reference frequency, relative to A = 440Hz. E.g. set the parameter to -8 for A = 432Hz.
