| **A = gate from X &gt; Y** |
|----------------------------|
| **B = inverted gate**      |
| **Z is hysteresis**        |

Output A is a gate signal (zero or +5V), high when input X has a higher voltage than input Y. Output B is an inverted
copy of A (i.e. +5V when A is 0V and vice versa.)

The Z knob/CV input sets the hysteresis (for an explanation of hysteresis see ). Inputs of approximately 0-4V correspond
to hysteresis values of approximately 0-10V. Negative values are clamped at zero.
