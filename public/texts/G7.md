Performs a MIDI to CV conversion on MIDI notes arriving at the Disting's MIDI port.

The received MIDI channel is selected in the settings.
                
Parameter **6** sets the mode of operation.

- in mode 0: Output **A** is the pitch CV output; output **B** is the gate output.
- in mode 1: Output **A** is the pitch CV output; output **B** is another pitch CV output using the next MIDI channel up.
- in mode 2: Output **A** is the pitch CV output; output **B** is a velocity gate output.

Outputs A & B can also be controlled directly via MIDI CCs according to the following table:

| **CC (A/B)** | **Output voltage range** |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| 33/34        | -5V to +5V               |
| 35/36        | 0V to 10V                |
| 37/38        | 0V to 5V                 |
| 39/40        | 0V to 8V                 |

Parameter **2** selects a scale to use, if any are provided on the SD card. See “Scala Support” in the doc. The default value of
-1 disables this function.

Parameter **3** enables a 'fingered portamento' effect, that is, a glide from one note to the next if they are played
legato. Higher parameter values give a slower glide.

Parameter **4** enables an interruption of the gate output when notes are played legato. The parameter value sets the time
in milliseconds to send the gate low when a new note is played.

Parameter **5** sets the note priority mode. The options are Last, Low, and High.
