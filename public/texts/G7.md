Performs a MIDI to CV conversion on MIDI notes arriving on the disting's MIDI port.

The received MIDI channel is selected in the settings.

Parameter **6** sets the mode of operation.

In mode 0: Output **A** is the pitch CV output; output **B** is the gate output.

In mode 1: Output **A** is the pitch CV output; output **B** is another pitch CV output using the next MIDI channel up.

Outputs **A** & **B** can also be controlled directly via MIDI CCs 33 & 34 respectively (the CC range of 0-127 is mapped to -5V
to +5V), or via MIDI CCs 35 & 36 (the CC range of 0-127 is mapped to 0V to 10V).

Parameter **2** selects a scale to use, if any are provided on the SD card. See “Scala Support” above. The default value of
-1 disables this function.

Parameter **3** enables a 'fingered portamento' effect, that is, a glide from one note to the next if they are played
legato. Higher parameter values give a slower glide.

Parameter **4** enables an interruption of the gate output when notes are played legato. The parameter value sets the time
in milliseconds to send the gate low when a new note is played.

Parameter **5** sets the note priority mode. The options are Last, Low, and High.
