This algorithm is a __'bit crusher'__ - it applies sample rate and sample depth reduction to deliberately
introduce quantisation and aliasing artefacts. It also optionally applies bitwise modification of the
samples for non-linear distortion effects.

**X is the signal input.**

Y is the sample rate reduction CV input. It has a 1V/octave response i.e. the sample rate is reduced
by a factor of 2 for every 1V rise in CV. This CV is offset by parameter 0, so you can set a rate
reduction without a CV input.

**A is the signal output.**

B is the output of a comparator. Output A is compared against zero; output B is +5V if A is above
zero, or 0V if A is below zero.

The Z control sets the bit depth reduction. There are two types of bit reduction available:

- Type I - the signal is quantised to a 16 bit word, and the low bits thrown away. The
resulting signal uses a power of 2 bits. Changing between bit depths is therefore
discontinous.
- Type II - quantisation is achieved via the limited precision of integer maths when dividing
the signal by a factor. Since the factor can be continuously varied, this offers a smooth
variation between 'bit depths'.
Furthermore, positive and negative values of Z have different effects.
- Positive Z treats the whole signal range as one number to be quantised.
- Negative Z treats positive and negative sections of the input signal differently. Negative
sections are flipped positive, quantized, and flipped back.

Parameter 1 selects the type of bit reduction. The positive and negative sections of the input signal
can have different types of reduction applied.
