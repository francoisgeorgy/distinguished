Algorithm-specific playlist filename: midi-playlist-free.txt  
This algorithm plays MIDI files, converting the MIDI into CV outputs on **A** & **B** (as detailed above).

The current MIDI file is selected via the parameter i.e. by turning the S knob.

The playback speed is set by a combination of the **Z** knob/CV and the **X** CV. With both at zero, the MIDI file plays at
120bpm. **Z** offers a linear speed control - positive voltages speed up playback; negative voltages slow it down. Because
the scale is linear it is possible to slow it down all the way to being stopped. **X** offers an exponential (1V/octave)
speed control - the speed doubles for every 1V above zero, and halves for every 1V below zero.

Y is a retrigger input . A trigger pulse in excess of 1V will reset the file to the beginning.**MIDI Output**: the MIDI
file being played is transmitted unaltered on the disting's MIDI output.
