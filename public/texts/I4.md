This algorithm is much the same as the 'I-1 Audio Playback' algorithm, except that it forgoes voltage control of the
current sample and instead offers a speed control.

**Z** is the linear speed control. The central position corresponds to the sample playing at its natural pitch. Positive
voltages speed up playback; negative voltages slow it down. Because the scale is linear it is possible to slow it down
all the way to being stopped.

The current sample is selected via parameter **1**.

Parameters **0** & **2** are the standard sample folder and envelope time parameters, described above.

**MIDI Input**: MIDI note
on & off messages are handled equivalently to a trigger or gate on the **X** input â€“ that is, a note on retriggers the
sample, and if the envelope time is non-zero, a note off will stop the playback.
