**Tap tempo enabled**

This algorithm is a two-stage (attack/decay) envelope generator, whose overall time is set from an input clock pulse.
The envelope is triggered by a separate trigger pulse.

Input **X** is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. The time between rising trigger edges is used
to set the envelope time.

Parameter **0** applies a multiplier to the envelope time, according to the table above.

Input **Y** is a trigger input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used . A rising clock pulse triggers the envelope.

Z sets the envelope shape, from short attack & long decay, to long attack and short decay.

Parameters 3 & 4 set the attack and decay shapes of the envelope respectively, from an exaggerated exponential curve at
0 to an almost linear shape at 32.

A & **B** both output the envelope CV. Parameters 1 & 2 are attenuverters, which can attenuate and/or invert the signal for
each output independently. The unattenuated envelope level is 8V.

If parameter **1** is set to the special value 41, output **A** becomes an end-of-cycle trigger output, generating a 10ms 5V
pulse at the end of the envelope's release stage.
