This is a stereo version of the Clockable SD Delay algorithm as described above. Being stereo, the maximum delay time is
halved, to a mere 48 minutes.  

Please be sure to read the 'SD card requirements' box in K6 description.

This algorithm is affected by the 'SD delay max' setting â€“ see above.
