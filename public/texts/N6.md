This algorithm is a phase shifter – it generates two outputs, one of which is in a fixed phase
relationship to the other. Unlike the Phaser algorithm (see above), which is simply designed to
create a swooshy sound, this algorithm is designed for mathematical accuracy, and can produce
some interesting psycho-acoustic effects. It can also produce swooshy sounds.

Input **X** is the signal input.

Input **Y** is the phase shift input, scaled as 5V per 360°. **Parameter 1** is added to the total shift – a
value of 32 gives 360°, so a parameter value of 8 gives 90° i.e. quadrature.

**A** and **B** are the audio outputs, which are phase shifted according to the Y CV and **parameter 1**.
Note that neither is an identical copy of the input waveform (unless the input happens to be a sine
wave).

**Parameter 0** sets the output mode. When 0, the phase of output **A** stays constant and output **B** is
shifted as described above. When the parameter is 1, output **A** is also shifted, in the opposite
direction.

**Z** is a wet/dry control. At zero, the output is 100% dry i.e. the input signal with no phase shifted
signal added.

For **positive Z**, the phase shifted signal is added while holding the dry level constant.

For **negative Z**, the dry and phase shifted signals are progressively crossfaded, until eventually the
output is 100% wet i.e. just the phase shifted signal.

**Parameter 2** enables an LFO on the phase shift. When enabled, **parameter 3** sets the LFO speed.
