This algorithm is a voltage controlled delay line, with a maximum
delay time of just over 200ms. As well as simple echoes, this can
produce a wide variety of effects such as vibrato, chorus and flange.

A control signal of 0-8V on the **Y** input sets the delay time, with a
linear voltage/time relationship. Parameter **0** can be used to set this to a 'centre' value, 
which makes it easier to patch in an LFO to the **Y**
input without having to add a DC offset to the LFO.

Parameter **1** is an attenuverter for **Y**, applied before the offset.

**Z** is a feedback control. It is zero at 0V input, and provides negative
feedback for negative voltages.

**A** outputs the delay signal only. Use this for vibrato effects, or if you want a controllable mix of dry and delayed signal.

**B** outputs the delay and dry signals mixed in equal amounts. In combination with an LFO on the delay time, this is the
quickest route to chorus/flange type effects.

Parameter **2** enables a saturation stage on the input to the delay line. This can prevent unpleasant distortion when the
feedback becomes high, at the expense of some colouration of the sound.
