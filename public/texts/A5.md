This algorithm provides a linear-to-exponential converter and an exponential-to-linear converter. You might use this to
interface 1V/octave modules (Eurorack standard) with Hz/V synths (e.g. old Korg or Yamaha synths), but it could also be
useful within Eurorack e.g. to convert an LFO (commonly with Hz/V pitch control) to a V/octave oscillator, or to convert
an exponential FM input on a VCO into a linear FM input.

Input X is the exponential input; its corresponding linear output is A. Y is the linear input, whose exponential output
is B.

Z sets the scale factor which is common to both conversions. It sets the number of Hz per Volt, with arrange from near
zero to about 2kHz. The Yamaha CS-15, for example, uses about 1100Hz/V, which is about half way on the Z knob here.

The zero Volt point on the exponential scale used is C3 (approximately 130.81Hz).

Parameters 0 & 1 switch their respective outputs to function as gate inverters. (Some old synths e.g. the Korg MS-20
have a Hz/V pitch input and an inverted gate, compared to the Eurorack norm.) The output is then 5V/0V for an input gate
in excess of 1V.
