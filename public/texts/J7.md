This algorithm is identical to 'J-5 Audio Recorder' except that the
files recorded are in mono, using the left (**X**) input, and the files
are placed in a folder named '!RECORD1'.

This can be useful when intending to use the recorded audio in the
disting's own playback modes, since mono samples place less stress on
the SD card throughput, and can be re-pitched higher.
