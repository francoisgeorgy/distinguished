Outputs A & B are slew rate limited versions of X & Y. If parameter 4 is 0, they are both based on the sum of X + Y; if
parameter 4 is 1, A is based on X, and B is based on Y.

Parameters 2 & 3 choose the type of slew rate limiting applied to A & B respectively. A parameter value of 0 gives
linear slew rate limiting; a step change in the input will typically result in a ramp output, until the output reaches
its desired value, at which point it will be constant. A parameter value of 1 gives logarithmic slew rate limiting; a
step change in input results in a smooth curve that gradually approaches the desired value.

The Z knob/CV controls the slew rate for both outputs. At the minimum value of Z, changes are very rapid. As Z
increases, changes take place more slowly.

Parameters 0 & 1 allow for independent control of the slew times when the signal is rising or falling. If each parameter
is -1, the corresponding slew rate is controlled by Z. Otherwise, the slew rate is set by the parameter value.
