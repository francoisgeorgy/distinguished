**Outputs MIDI**

Output **A** is a quantized version of input X; the closest whole-semitone value to the unquantized V/octave pitch CV X.
Similarly output **B** is a quantized version of input Y.

As well as providing a chromatic scale, this algorithm can also constrain the quantized values to a musical scale or
chord. This is controlled by the **Z** knob/CV.

When **Z** changes, the scale is displayed on the LEDs. The scale's number in the following table is shown, and after a
short pause, the scale's name.

| **Number** | **Scale**            | **Displayed name** |
|------------|----------------------|--------------------|

| 11         | root+5th+7th         | 5+7                |
| 12         | pentatonic major     | Pent               |
| 13         | pentatonic minor     | Minor Pent         |
| 14         | natural minor scale  | Nat Minor          |
| 15         | harmonic minor scale | Harm Minor         |

For each quantizer, a parameter provides a transpose control. The transposition is applied to the input before it is
forced into the chosen scale i.e. the transposition moves the notes around within the same key.

The quantized notes names are shown on the display (A left, **B** right). Natural notes are shown in capitals i.e. 'C', '
D', 'E' etc. Lower case letters indicate sharps e.g. 'c' indicates C sharp, 'd', indicates D sharp.

**MIDI Output**: each new note is output as a MIDI note message on the MIDI channel selected in the settings (input
X/output A) or on the next highest channel (input Y/output B). E.g. if the settings specify MIDI channel 4, the notes
are output on channels 4 (X/A) and 5 (Y/B).
