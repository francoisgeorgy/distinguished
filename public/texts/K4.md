This algorithm is essentially a version of the Clockable Wavetable LFO, but with a trigger input instead of being
free-running. As such it can be thought of as a kind of envelope generator, where the envelope shape is defined by an
audio file in the wavetable.

See 'Loading wavetables' above for a description of how to load wavetables onto the SD card.

Input **X** is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. The time between rising trigger edges is used
to set the envelope time.

The **Y** input controls the lookup point in the wavetable, with a range of Â±5V covering the whole table. Parameter **1**
offsets the **Y** CV, effectively providing a means of manual wave selection.

The **Z** input is the trigger for the envelope to start.

Outputs **A** & **B** are the result of the wavetable lookup. Each output has its own attenuverter on parameters 2 & 3
respectively.

Parameter **4** applies a multiplier to the envelope time, according to the table in the Clockable Delay/Echo section,
above.

Parameter **5** sets the triggering mode.
