This is a ping-pong version of the Clockable SD Delay algorithm as described above.

Being stereo, the maximum delay time is halved, to a mere 48 minutes.

Please be sure to read the 'SD card requirements' box.

Outputs **A** & **B** are the left and right outputs respectively. If the output mode parameter is 0 (the default), they are a
mix of the dry (undelayed)
signal and the delay effect. The amount of delay in the mix rises in direct proportion to the amount of feedback. If the
output mode parameter is 1, the outputs are the delayed signals only. Use this and the input signal, plus an external
mixer, if you need more flexibility in the dry/wet balance than is offered by output mode 0.

Parameter **2** controls the left/right pan position of the input signal.
