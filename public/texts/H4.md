Output **A** is a quantized version of input **X**; the closest whole-semitone value to the unquantized V/octave pitch CV **X**.

Similarly output **B** is a quantized version of input **Y**.

As well as providing a chromatic scale, this algorithm can also constrain the quantized values to a musical scale or
chord. This is controlled by parameters 2 & 3.

Additionally, the parameter being positive or negative controls whether the quantizer works in triggered mode or not.
The triggers are provided by input **Z** (approximately 1V is required to trigger it). If the parameter is negative, the
quantizer is triggered - the input is only sampled and converted to a new quantized value when triggered by input **Z**. If
the parameter is positive, the input is constantly sampled and a new note is output as soon as the input moves into the
next semitone range.

If the scale selected is 'MIDI 1' or 'MIDI 2' (values 17 & 18) the
candidate notes for quantization are set via MIDI. The algorithm
listens for MIDI note on messages and uses the received notes for the
quantization pattern. While any notes are held, playing new notes adds
to the pattern. When all notes are released and a new note played, the
pattern is reset and formed from the new note.

In 'MIDI 1' mode the played MIDI notes set the note names, but
quantization can happen in any octave (i.e. if you play a 'D' the
output will always be 'D' but the octave will depend on the octave of
the incoming CV).

In 'MIDI 2' mode the played MIDI notes are the only ones that can be
output (so say if you play middle C and the D above, the output will
always be one of those two notes, depending on whether the input CV is
below or above middle C).

The quantized notes names are shown on the display (A left, B right).
Natural notes are shown in capitals i.e. 'C', 'D', 'E' etc. Lower case
letters indicate sharps e.g. 'c' indicates C sharp, 'd', indicates D
sharp.

**MIDI Output**: each new note is output as a MIDI note message on the
MIDI channel selected in the settings (input **X**/output A) or on the
next highest channel (input **Y**/output **B**). E.g. if the settings specify
MIDI channel 4, the notes are output on channels 4 (X/A) and 5 (Y/B).

The MIDI Gate parameter works in the same way as for the Quantizer,
above.
