Similar to “I-7 Dual Audio Playback” except that the sample playback speed is controlled by the **Z** knob/CV input.

The two samples are selected by parameters 1 & 2.

Parameter **3** selects the panning option – refer to the description in the algorithm above.

Parameter **4** selects which samples are affected by the speed control, as follows:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Param 4</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>0</td>
<td>Both samples' speeds controlled by **Z**.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>1</td>
<td>Sample **A** speed fixed; **B** variable.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>2</td>
<td>Sample **B** speed fixed; **A** variable.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>3</td>
<td>Both samples' speeds are fixed.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Parameters **0** & **5** are the standard sample folder and envelope time parameters, described above.

The triggers are 'velocity sensitive' – the volume of the sample depends on the voltage of the trigger pulse.

**MIDI Input**: MIDI note on & off messages are handled equivalently to a trigger or gate on the **X** & **Y** inputs – that is,
a note on retriggers the sample, and if the envelope time is non-zero, a note off will stop the playback. MIDI note 48 (
C3) triggers sample A; note 49 triggers sample **B**.
