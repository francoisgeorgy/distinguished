**Tap tempo enabled**

This algorithm is a two-stage (attack/decay) envelope generator, whose overall time is set from an input clock pulse.
The envelope is continuously output (starting on each new clock pulse) unless muted.

Input **X** is the clock input. Any clock pulse in excess of 1V can be used. The time between rising trigger edges is used
to set the envelope time.

Parameter **0** applies a multiplier to the envelope time, according to the table above.Input **Y** is a mute input. While this
input is over 1V, the output is forced to 0V.

**Z** sets the envelope shape, from short attack & long decay, to long attack and short decay.

Parameters **3** & **4** set the attack and decay shapes of the envelope respectively, from an exaggerated exponential curve at
0 to an almost linear shape at 32.

**A** & **B** both output the envelope CV. Parameters **1** & **2** are attenuverters, which can attenuate and/or invert the signal for
each output independently. The unattenuated envelope level is 8V.

If parameter **1** is set to the special value 41, output **A** becomes an end-of-cycle trigger output, generating a 10ms 5V
pulse at the end of the envelope's release stage.
