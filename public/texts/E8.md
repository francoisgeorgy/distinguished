This algorithm is for interfacing Buchla synths with Eurorack (or more generally, any analogue synths using the
1V/octave standard).

Input **X**/Output **A** convert a pitch CV from the 1.2V/octave standard to the 1V/octave standard.

Input **Y** is intended to receive a Buchla-format combined trigger & gate signal (typically a 10V trigger pulse followed by
a sustained 5V gate). From this, output **B** generates just the trigger pulse (at 5V). If you need the gate signal, you can
directly use the Buchla output.

The **Z** knob/CV provides a tuning control, with a range of approximately Â±0.5 octaves.
