This algorithm implements a fairly traditional stereo compressor.

X & **Y** are the stereo audio inputs; **A** & **B** are the stereo audio outputs.

The **Z** knob/CV sets the compression ratio, from 1 (no compression) at fully counterclockwise, to infinity (effectively
limiting rather than compression) at fully clockwise.

Parameter **0** sets the threshold level above which compression applies (in dB).

Parameters 1 & 2 set the attack and release times. The attack time range is approximately 0.1ms-1s; the release time
range is approximately 1ms-3s.

Parameter **3** sets the make-up gain (in dB). If set to -1, the make-up gain is calculated automatically from the threshold
and compression ratio.

Parameter **4** sets a lookahead time, effectively delaying the audio slightly relative to the envelope detection. This can
be used to ensure that sharp transients are not lost during the attack time of the envelope. The maximum lookahead is
about 10ms.
