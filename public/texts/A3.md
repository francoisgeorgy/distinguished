| **A = abs( X + Y ) or abs( X )** |
|----------------------------------|
| **B = abs( X - Y ) or abs( Y )** |
| **Z selects mode**               |

This algorithm provides a full-wave rectifier or absolute value function. The Z knob/CV select between one of two modes.
In
'independent' mode, A and B are the absolute values of X and Y, respectively. In 'combined' mode, A is the absolute
value of the sum of X & Y; B is the absolute value of the difference of X & Y.

When Z changes, the mode is displayed. 'Independent' mode is shown as
"-0"; 'combined' mode as "0". After a short while the display reverts to showing the current algorithm.
