Output **A** is a quantized version of input **X**; the closest whole-semitone value to the unquantized V/octave pitch CV **X**.

Output **B** is a trigger signal which fires whenever output **A** changes - a 5V pulse approximately 10ms long.

As well as providing a chromatic scale, this algorithm can also constrain the quantized values to a musical scale or
chord. This is controlled by the **Z** knob/CV.

When **Z** changes, the scale is displayed on the LEDs. The scale's number in the following table is shown, and after a
short pause, the scale's name.

| **Number** | **Scale**            | **Displayed name** |

A further option is controlled by **Z** being positive or negative. When **Z** is negative, the scale number is shown as a
negative value.

**When **Z** is positive** input **Y** is a transpose control. The CV on input **Y** is quantized (to a chromatic scale) and added
to the quantized result in one of two ways, controlled by parameter **1**. If parameter **1** is zero, the transposition is
applied to output A, after input **X** has been quantized to the chosen scale. If parameter **1** is one, the transposition is
applied to input **X** before it is forced into the chosen scale. So, in mode zero the overall key of the quantization is
transposed, whereas in mode one the transposition moves the notes around within the same key.

**When **Z** is negative** input **Y** is a trigger. In this mode, input **X** is only sampled and converted to a new quantized
value when input **Y** rises over approximately 1V. (In non-triggered mode, **X** is constantly sampled and a new note is output
as soon as **X** moves into the next semitone range.)

**Parameter 2** sets the root **key** of the chosen scale. At zero, the first note of the scale (e.g. C in the key of C)
corresponds to 0V. If the parameter is set for example to 2, the first note of the scale is at 2/12 = 0.1667V - or to
look at it another way, if your VCO is tuned so that 0V gives you a C, the quantizer is now working in the key of D (D
major, minor, triad etc. depending on the scale setting).

**Parameter 3** sets an offset between the timing of the **X** & **Y** inputs (in sample frames). When using **Y** as a trigger, it is
often a good idea to delay it slightly relative to the pitch, to ensure that the pitch has changed and settled before
the trigger samples a new note.

**Parameter 5** applies transposition, exactly as per the description of using **Y** for transposition above.
Note that transposition with parameter **5** is always available, even if **Y** is being used as a trigger.

**MIDI Output**: each new note (i.e. when the Output **B** trigger fires) is output as a MIDI note message on the MIDI
channel selected in the settings.

**Parameter 4** controls when note off messages are sent. If parameter **4** is zero (the default), the note off is sent just
before the note on â€“ so the note lasts from one change to the next, which is conceptually the same as the CV output. If
parameter **4** is one, and **Z** is negative (so **Y** is a trigger), then the trigger is treated as a gate, and the note off
message is sent when the gate goes low.

**MIDI Input**: MIDI note messages received on MIDI channel 1 set parameter **2** (root key).
